# The Videogame Archive

The Videogame Archive is a website aimed at archiving videogames writing. From large websites like IGN to smaller blogs like [Free Indie Games](https://www.freeindiegam.es/), the goal is collate writing about games in a searchable way, and preserve these writings beyond the frail lifetimes of the internet ecosystem.
