~ KNOW 
who you ane 
We know youÅfre a dedicated videogamer who 
thirsts for knowledge on the very latest titles 
We know youÅfre only interested in the very best 
the gaming world has to offer 
We know youÅfre hungry for information about 
the next wave of gaming technology 
So we know youÅfre going to love EDGE 
This magazine is brought to you by dedicated, 
hardened gameplayers and experts in all fields of 
videogaming technology. As well as extensive 
coverage of what matters in the Mega Drive, 
Super Nintendo and PC markets, Edge taps into 
a huge underworld of videogame entertainment 
that simply isnÅft covered anywhere else. It 
answers questions other magazines donÅft even 
know how to ask... 
Just how are the latest games being created? 
Edge is first to speak to the designers behind 
Microcosm, the groundbreaking CD-ROM game 
from Psygnosis. The interviews start on page 70. 
What machine will you be playing on next 
year? Only one magazine in the UK has been 
permitted inside the 3DO company to see their 
revolutionary new Interactive Multiplayer  and 
youÅfre holding it: the full inside story on 3DO 
begins on page 48. 
What special techniques are being 
developed to make games even better? No-one 
else has even mentioned that SNES King ArthurÅfs 
World has Surround Sound music and effects. 
Edge tells you exactly how it was done  and 
why itÅfs important. Find out on page 60. 
Every issue we'll be fighting to ensure 
youÅfre ahead of the field for news and previews 
of videogames. And when we arenÅft first with a game, itÅfs because itÅfs not worth your time... or 
because we'll be bringing you the whole story  
not just a handful of intro screenshots and a 
mouthful of garbled rumour. 
We'll cover the best stories, in more detail, 
with more information than anyone else. 
Depend on it. . 
Yes, Edge is expensive. But information 
doesnÅft come cheap: in this first issue alone, 
hundreds of manhours were spent visiting 
software houses across the US and throughout 
Japan, talking to programmers and designers, 
investigating news stories around the world. 
And, above all, we take videogames 
seriously. The UK market for games is now 
worth over Åí600 million  getting on for twice 
the entire CD audio market. So Edge will be 
making sure you know the truth about the 
hardware, the software, and the people who 
make the decisions affecting the games you play. 
Finally, as is quite obvious, Edge isnÅft for 
everyone. But if you think itÅfs for you, perhaps 
you'll take a minute or two to fill out the 
questionnaire (page || 1) and tell us what you 
feel about this first issue. Seriously, we 
want to know. 
Welcome to Edge. Now get in _ 
there and enjoy the magazine! 
The future is almost here...

of January '94. 
Commodore unveiled the machine at

In context 
Commodore and Atari 
were both built by the 
same man: Polish 
concentration camp 
survivor Jack Tramiel. 
CommodoreÅfs first 
computer, launched in 
1976, was the PET 
(incidentally, a bad name 
to call a computer in 
France, where ÅepetÅf has 
some link with farting). 
Early demand was so 
strong Commodore 
charged the full $795 
($795!)  and made the 
customer wait six 
months. (Things are 
different now. You donÅft 
have to pay in advance, 
though waiting is still 
fairly common.) 
On Friday, 13th 
January 1984 Jack 
Tramiel resigned from 
Commodore. In July he 
bought Atari from Warner 
 who effectively sold the 
company to him by 
loaning him the money to 
buy it. Then, in late July 
1984 Commodore bought 
a company. The name? 
Amiga Computer. 
The Home Computer 
Wars were about to 
begin...

All in all, the CD32 looks as if it has the 
guts, the technology, the price and the 
software support to go up against Mega CD 
and the SNES in Europe. What it doesnÅft 
have, however, is the Åekiller appÅf  the killer 
application such as the Sonic or Starfox 
(sorry, Wing)  that gives people a reason to 
buy instead of merely to dream. 
Meanwhile, Atari . . 
committed to launching their make or break 
64bit RISC-based 16-million-colour palette 
Jaguar console in America this Christmas at 
a sensational price of just $200 (Åí135). In 
this country it will be released, so it is 
promised, in April Åe94 at a still stunning 
Åí199 with one game and two keypads. But 
then, no-oneÅfs believed a word Atari has said 
for years unless supported by the evidence of 
their own eyes. 
The core of the machine is the 64bit 
processor, a chipset Atari designed 
themselves in this country at their 
Cambridge-based 
research facility (using 
the old Perihelion 
transputer team). This 
chipset works in

Park is going to CD32 
at the same time as every other format (a 
bundle deal is pending licence problems: 
Commodore hasnÅft paid a penny for the 
Jurassic logo  Edge). With Ocean backing 
the machine there is no doubt that software 
support is substantial. 
CD32Åfs success would be very welcome to 
the UK software industry, not so much 
because of the protection CD offers against 
piracy  a problem that dogged anyone 
supporting the Amiga  but because 
Commodore's attitude in terms of pay-dirt is 
far more amiable than either of the big 
Japanese players.

The financial 
status of Atari 
AtariÅfs last full year 
figures, for the year ending 
December 31st 1992, 
showed turnover halved to 
$127-3 million and a loss of 
$73-6 million. Like 
Commodore, the firm 
talked of writeoffs and 
restructure, but itÅfs still 
losing money. 
For the quarter ending 
March 31st 1993, turnover 
was nearly a fifth of the 
total in the same period of 
1992 and it suffered losses 
of another $2 million. 
Despite all this, Atari 
claim to have $40 million 
(Åí27 million) available for 
the launch of the Jaguar. 
However, with both Sega 
and Nintendo competing 
for a share of the market, 
and both with similar 
marketing budgets, Atari 
have their work cut out. 
Falcon fails 
AtariÅfs attempts to strike a 
blow in the technowars 
have been as dire as 
CommodoreÅfs, though 
theyÅfre slower to admit it. 
Last year the firm 
launched Falcon - the 
machine; it claimed, to 
wrestle power back from 
the console brigade and 
put computers back on the 
map. (Ironic, since Atari 
invented the videogame 
market  and then, through 
inept management, sent it 
back to oblivion during the 
the mid-80s.) 
It was going to get in all 
the major high street 
chains. So far itÅfs made it 
into a miserable 12% of 
independent stores 
(source: CTW annual 
survey 1993).

huge library of video clips, opening the door 
to the inclusion of film footage which can be 
shown in its original state. The move is 
apparently a parry to SonyÅfs forays into the 
video game market. 
In order to avoid bringing the product to 
the market late (as if), Atari have 
contracted huge Jurassic Park inhabitant 
IBM to manufacture the units in a deal 
which will net the the ailing US giant a 
reputed $500 million. Although IBMÅfs 
director of Applications Solutions said, ÅeThis 
is a wonderful opportunity to work with 
Atari and their new system,Åf the rea/ reason 
is that cheap Japanese PCs have crucified 
their profits and IBM is in big, big trouble. 
Even so, it will take more than a deal 
with Atari to get the giant out of the 
quicksand: the Washington Post pointed out 
that $500 million, according to an analyst 
at Brown Brothers in NY, is Åenot even two- 
tenths of 1% of [IBMÅfs] revenue. I 
dismissed [the Atari deal] as trivial.Åf 
The British Jaguar package, 
supposedly retailing at Åí199 (but we'll 
believe it when we see it), includes one game 
and two keypads. These ten key joypads were 
originally created for Falcon and look like a 
hybrid of the Mega Drive and SNES 
varieties. But for a supposed multimedia 
machine, the first lineup of software for the 
Jaguar is suspiciously games-oriented: titles 
destined for the new MegaCarts include 
Cybermorph, Aliens Vs Predator, Jaguar 
Formula One Racing plus a pair of 
souped-up ancient Atari games, Battlezone 
2000 and Tempest 2000. And, of course, 
Jeff Minter will produce an interactive shoot 
Ågem up with llamas in it. 
As we go to press there are 25 Jaguars 
- jn the country, each with a development 
team. All the major software houses, with 
the exception of Electronic Arts (wouldnÅft 
sign the non-disclosure agreement), Gametek 
(MD is ex-Commodore boss Kelly Sumner) 
and Psygnosis (owned by Sony, in bed with 
Commodore), recently attended a product 
briefing at the Ramada Hotel near 
Heathrow. Daryll Still (Atari UKÅfs

going to Åeadvertise the shit out of JaguarÅf

Sega is looking to move out from under

with ventures that will be impossible to 
ignore. It is already planning to create what 
that Pirate TV ad was hinting at: a Sega 
Channel. The firm has linked up with Time 
Warner (the largest entertainment company 
in the world) and Tele-Communications 
Inc (TCI) in the US, and together the 
companies are launching a new cable 
television company to pump Sega games through a decoder box directly into the TV 
on a special channel. 
The project begins in earnest in 
September with trial runs in 350,000 
households across 13 US cities. The cost of 
subscribing is $10-$15 (Åí7-Åí10) a month, 
plus $20 (Åí30) for a lead linking the Genesis 
cart slot and the cable TV receiver. 
Ultimately, Sega could have access to 20 
million cable TV owners in the States  and 
Europe may not be far behind. European

Electronic Arts  went

Tre wee at birth...  20,000 square feet. 
On a global scale, Sega is already a 
major player in the arcade market. It 
currently operates well over 1,000 
Amusement Centres worldwide. But the 
FECs are a big step forward from those 
centres. Jafrato explains: ÅeThese are not 
places for wayward youths. These are for the

things like that. TheyÅfre also huge, designed 
to feature machines like the AS-1 and R-360

The deal between the two companies is 
worth Åí3-2 million over two years. The 
earliest manifestations of SegaÅfs virtual 
reality kit will be in its games centres, or as 
Waldern describes them, in Location Based 
Entertainment (LBE) centres. But work is 
also underway on games for the home.

the games scene generally. ÅeTelevision and 
video technology will merge. Multimedia

But how will all this 
affect your humble 
Mega Drive, the not-so- 
humble Sega VR 
peripheral and the not- 
very-humble-at-all 32-bit Saturn console? 
The biggest impact will be on Sega itself. 
Consoles have been growing fast these last 
few years, but it canÅft last forever. Sega is 
establishing itself in other markets; itÅfs all 
about eggs and baskets. As Jafrato 
concludes, ÅeweÅfre not just a console 
company, weÅfre a multimedia leisure ro 
companyÅf. And whoÅfs to argue? 
Next stop... 
Saturn? 
SegaÅfs next-generation machine, the 
Saturn, boasts a 32-bit RISC chip running 
at 27MHz, 24-bit graphics and, not 
surprisingly, a polygon generator. 
This chip can display and animate 
16,000 polygons per second  which 
doesnÅft sound so impressive in 
comparison to Virtua RacingÅfs 180,000 
polygons per second. 
Interestingly, the Saturn graphics chip 
also includes an alpha channel for 
transparent colours and digital 
compositing  ideal for games containing 
video footage. 
Considering the amount of 
information needed to feed these data- 
hungry processors, rumours of it being a 
CD-only machine had better be true. 
However, given the considerable 
slippage of the Mega CD, SegaÅfs planned 
launch date of 1994 seems unlikely.

Aladdin x2 
for Xmas 
Aladdin on the Mega 
Drive contains real 
Disney animation 
YouÅfve probably heard 
about AladdinÅfs success in 
the States, it being second 
only to Jurassic Park in box 
office takings anÅf all that. 
But with the film being held 
over for a Christmas release 
in Europe (there are 
dinosaurs out there, you 
know) Capcom and Sega 
are gearing up their 
respective SNES and Mega 
Drive versions for a 
simultaneous seasonal 
release, worldwide. 
And the similarly 
lush-looking SNES 
version from Capcom 
And you can bet that 
thereÅfll be a swordfight as 
to which company makes 
the most noise, and makes 
the best game of the film. 
In one corner we have 
VirginÅfs goldenboy 
programmer, Dave Perry, 
and a whole horde of Disney 
animators shaping the (it 
has to be said) stunning 
Mega Drive version. And in 
the other we have Capcom 
doing what they do best. 
How about it THQ? PHILIPS 
PhilipsÅf CD-i player (above) is the first machine to go the FMV route, using PhilipsÅf 
own FMV upgrade cartridge (top left); the 1Mb MPEG cart simply slots in the back of 
the player (top right). First film available on CD? Frauds, starring Phil Collins 
 their games, but have been held back by data 
storage technology. Never mind whether the 
hardware can handle million-colour 
graphics, hi-fi sound and high-speed 
animation  the data alone would take 
hundreds of floppies, or cartridges the size 
of car batteries. 
But CD-ROM is 
the answer to all that, 
with its huge (650Mb) 
storage capacity. 
Indeed, thereÅfs so 
much space that, with 
state-of-the-art 
compression 
techniques, it turns out 
you can get up to 72 
minutes of video 
footage on a single CD. 
All you need now 
is the hardware for 
getting off the CD and 
into your computer... 
CD-based games. ., 
work like normal games. Ordinarily, code is 
copied off a disk and into the machineÅfs 
RAM, where itÅfs stored, manipulated, and 
generally messed around with. But RAM 
isnÅft cheap  and certainly not the sort of 
RAM needed to cope with real-time video 
clips. So developers get round this by using 
the CD drive as a ÅeplayerÅf, where the video 
clips are effectively read straight into the 
machineÅfs display. No delay, no interaction  
just like watching a video. Except that you 
donÅft have to wait while the tape rewinds to 
find the clip you want, and a clip can be shouldnÅft

direction of Full 
Motion Video for

Stewart Bonn, Vice President of 
CD-ROM development at EA America aborted or switched at the touch of a 
joystick button. 
Until this year, full-motion video, and 
its promise of VHS-quality output has been a 
dream. The sort of computer hardware home 
users can afford isnÅft set up to handle 
millions of colours 
onscreen at once, and 
ÅeGame CD-drives arenÅft set up 
= to recover real-time 
designers video clips from a CD. 
The latter involves 
pulling frames off the 
CD at the rate of 25 per 
second  the PAL 
refresh rate. Not only 
that, you have to 
compress these frames 
massively to fit the 
current maximum of 72 
minutes of full-motion 
video on to a single 
disk. The compression 
is handled by the 
powerful MPEG system (version 1: MPEG2 
is already in the works). But it means that 
the individual video frames have to be 
decompressed on the fly  in between screen 
refreshes  which is a hell of a job for the 
hardware. But itÅfs perfectly possible. It 
means that each video frame occupies a 
maximum of 6K on disc, which limits the 
playback quality, but the manufacturers 
insist that itÅfs still better than VHS, even if 
itÅfs not as good as broadcast quality. (From 
what Edge has seen, VHS has little to fear.) 
Philips will be the first to enter the 
FMV arena later this year when they

American company SuperMacÅfs CinePak 
system  the video compression software 
used by Apple and Microsoft. CinePak is 
purely software-based, but the intention is 
just the same: to market the Mega CD as an 
FMV-capable machine. 
Treating FMV ......... 
orientated development is a mistake: the 
implications are far wider. Those two great 
leviathans the film industry and the music 
industry are more than a little interested... 
In June this year Philips and 
Paramount Pictures signed a deal which 
meant that films would appear on CD-i as 
well as video. And part of the deal was that 
Philips would be exploring the possibility of 
interactive versions of films, too. 
At the same time, Philips announced 
13 new FMV music titles  you donÅft just get 
to listen to an album on CD, you get to 
watch it too. 
Philips are pushing their CD-i system 
for all itÅfs worth (and a bit more besides, to 
be honest). Their technology isnÅft 
pioneering; their marketing is. But even so, 
theyÅfre only pre-empting something that was 
going to happen anyway. The 12cm CD looks 
like being the universal storage medium of 
tomorrow  itÅfs happened in music, itÅfs 
happening in games and it will shortly 
happen with films. 
And these three huge industries are on 
a collision course. Games developers have 
spotted the appeal of high-quality video 
sequences, music publishers are aware of the 
appeal of sound plus vision, while film 
makers have spotted that the possibility of 
Åeaudience participationÅf in interactive films. 
FMV will never be a substitute for 
gameplay, but the evidence of pseudo-F MV 
titles like Night Trap suggest that it ro 
can certainly heighten the experience.

Inflight 
driving 
Sky-tired Japanese 
businessmen can now 
ease away the stresses of 
jetflight by getting all hot 
and bothered on Mega 
Drive games. 
Japanese airline JAL 
have struck a deal with 
Sega to install the Sega 
Mega Jet. The Game 
Gear-sized unit accepts 
standard Japanese Mega 
Drive carts and is linked 
to a small LCD screen 
which folds out of the 
seat arm, and also 
doubles as a standard TV. 
There are 24 Mega Jets 
on each flight - 
presumably stashed in 
first class  and there are 
four titles to choose from 
including Super Monaco 
GP 2 (good job you can 
take your own, then). Pioneer LaserActive 
becomes reality 
PioneerÅfs LaserActive system. Plug-in modules enable it to play Mega Drive, Mega 
CD, PC Engine, PC Engine CD and LaserActive games. Talk about videorgasms... 
* ioneerÅfs joint venture with NEC and 
Sega, to produce a multiplatform 
== home entertainment system, has 
already reached Japanese consumers. 
First announced back in February this 
year, LaserActive goes on sale in Japan on 
August 20 (tomorrow, if youÅfve bought Edge 
on its day on release) and is expected to 
retail at a wallet-trembling 89,800 (Åí575). 
And that doesnÅft include any of the hardware 
you'll need to play games. 
In many ways, Pioneer have offered 
Sega and NEC a viable route in the face of 
the looming power of 3DO. In itÅfs fully 
expanded form, their LaserActive player can 
run LaserDiscs, audio CDs, CD+Gs, Mega 
Drive carts, Mega CDs, PC Engine HuCards, 
PC Engine CDs, (and hereÅfs where it gets 
interesting) new Sega Mega LD games and 
new PC Engine LD-ROM2 games, too. And 
these new formats are being supported by 
NEC and Sega to take advantage of the 
full-motion video capabilities of LaserActive. 
But, and hereÅfs the snag, LaserActive 
needs additional hardware to play games. In 
the front of the unit thereÅfs a slot where a 
choice of different modules can be plugged 
in. The first one costs 39,000 (Åí250) and 
allows you to play Mega Drive carts, Mega 
CDs and, when they appear, Mega LD games. 
The other module, for NEC games, 
costs a more modest 20,000 (Åí128) and 
lets you play HuCard games, Super 
CD-ROM2 games and, again, when they 
appear, LD-ROM2 games. 
The games modules contain the Sega 
and NEC circuitry for running standard 
cartridge games and CD/LD games, while the 
LaserActiveÅfs own modified drive and laser 
SRRESEEHTOSEHHSHOOERETEH OHHH BEEEEOE pickup handles all the different kinds of 
video, audio and games discs. 
No doubt about it, the LaserActive is a 
great idea for the ultra-rich gameplayers who 
want to get the best of Sega and NEC game 
systems, without the hassle of separate units, 
cables and plugs. 
But PioneerÅfs hopes for the system are 
naturally looking beyond this primary 
function of playing existing games formats. 
So, with companies like NEC, Sega, Taito 
and Hudson Soft developing LaserActive 
compatible Mega LD and LD-ROM2 
software, we can expect to see Sega and 
NEC games using that dangerously 
un-interactive element, full-motion video, 
with the first software expected in October. 
Which, low and behold, is 3D0Åfs 
launch date. So: low-powered multiplatform 
games system with high quality full-motion 
video (LaserActive) vs high-powered single 
format games system with low-quality ro 
full-motion video (3D0). Any bets? 
The first dedicated LaserActive game is 
from Pioneer. This amazing science 
fiction shoot 'em up, features lovely 
rendered robots... like this one News

July was the queue 
season again in Japan, 
with the bulk of the

Famicom releases finally 
being let loose on the 
eager Japanese public. 
Topping the bill was 
Street Fighter IT Turbo 
on July 10, followed by 
Super Mario Collection 
released on the 14th. 
Both games were 
highly anticipated by 
Japanese players, but 
shops were spared the 
enormous queues simply 
because of the 
notoriously wet weather 
Tokyo experiences at this 
time of year. 
Few braved the 
overnight camps that 
usually form outside the 
game shops the night 
before, in fear of getting 
soaked! This was echoed 
in the queue numbers 
with the two hig SNES 
releases managing only 
queues of around 2,000 
people at the biggest 
game shop, Bic Camera in 
the Akihabara district of 
Tokyo, compared to the 
12,000 that waited for 
Dragon Quest V outside 
the same shop back in

EA look to 
CD future 
Electronic Arts, the 
biggest leisure software 
publisher in the world, is 
abandoning the floppy 
disk market. 
The firmÅfs president, 
Mark Lewis, told Edge 
that within two years he 
fully expects all his 
companyÅfs product to 
appear only on compact 
disc and cartridge. 
EA is the first firm to 
announce such a move, 
but they already have a 
reputation for leading 
where others soon follow. 
Mark Lewis, European 
President of EA said, 
ÅeThere are some PC 3-5Åh 
disk games in progress, 
but from now on any 
home computer 
development will be 
concentrated on CD.Åf 
As well as a belief that 
within two years 50% of 
all PCs will have CD 
drives, EAÅfs move has 
also been prompted by 
more practical 
considerations. ÅeThe sort 
of game weÅfre producing 
on PC now needs 7-10 
high density floppy disks 
 thatÅfs an expensive and 
volatile media. Switching 
to CD should bring down 
the cost of goods to us 
and, ultimately, the cost 
of PC games to the 
consumer.Åf

that EA has yet to launch

sequel shuffle again 
Once EA finds a winning 
formula it never lets go 
does it? But who can 
blame them when Sega 
players keep picking up 
the sequels? 
The well impressive 
Jungle Strike hogs the 
number one slot (until 
NHL '94 slides in for the 
tackle) and PGA 2 is 
still at number 5. 
Looks like MD fans 
are wising up: thereÅfs 
precious little trash in 
the top ten these days  
if only the same could 
be said about the Mega 
CD chart... 
Gau (6,800) 
4. Illusion City

Fullprice games (and 
they are very full price) 
dominate the top slot. 
However, the 
Åesignificantly cheaper 
but still not budgetÅf 
Team 17 continue to 
place highly, with their 
very polished and dead 
playable titles.

A selection of screens 
from Dungeon Master II 
on the PC and Amiga.

Publisher: Unknown (Am) 
Developer: FTL 
Origin: US (all) 
he original Dungeon 
Master caused rioting 
in the streets when it 
appeared on the ST in 
early '88 and probably 
had more influence on 
the sales of STs than Atari ever did. 
It sold huge numbers, out-foxed the 
pirates and single-handedly 
revolutionised the roleplaying game 
genre. Sure, itÅfs old hat today, but it 
was way ahead of its time. 
Nobody expected that a sequel 
would take years to arrive. Four years, 
to be precise. Dungeon Master II is 
mostly the fruit of the last two yearÅfs 
work, and itÅfs good to see that the 
original gameÅfs designers have created 
DM II, and not farmed the work off to 
hopeless YTS under-achievers. But has 
it been worth the wait? And will RPG 
fansÅf social skills plummet to new 
depths as they get hooked on the next 
wave of Dungeon Master? 
Well, itÅfs highly likely. What, at 
first, looks like a rehash of the original 
game, with the same step-block screen 
update and a similar interface, 
actually hides an immensely complex 
piece of programming. What separates 
Dungeon Master II from the 
graphically state-of-the-art computer 
RPGs (like Forgotten Castle, see over) 
is the level of complexity in the 
gameplay environments. 
As a trade-off from the rather: 
dated scrolling, thereÅfs a very 
intelligent universe out there. The

monsters in the original just honed in 
on you, but these open doors, push 
buttons, pull levers, and think and 
learn for themselves. Hit a certain type 
of monster and theyÅfIl run away, heal 
their wounds, then get their friends to 
gang up on you. TheyÅfI! even pick up 
the objects you hurl at them, and 
throw them back at you. In fact the 
artificial intelligence is so advanced ItÅfs taken four 
years to arrive. 
And itÅfs got 
such intelligent 
monsters that 
that FTL are having to downgrade it 
to make it fairer. After all, having half even the 
the creatures from an entire level developers are 
hunting you down just isnÅft much fun. 
But as you might have guessed, in running 
DM II graphics take a relative back 
seat to gameplay (although the newer 
256 colour PC graphics are better 
than the 32 colour versions here). This 
is why you'll be seeing the game on the 
Amiga and Sega CD as well as the PC. 
For a detailed look at the = 
game check out the next Edge. scared. ItÅfs

RPG sequel 
He may look stupid (left) but 
DM IIs enemies are really smart.

J ans of the original Top

be delighted to hear 
m that thereÅfs a sequel on 
Me the way. Using an 
eight meg cart as opposed to the four 
of the original, the sequel boasts 
smoother, more detailed graphics and 
improved gameplay. 
In Top Gear 2 you travel through 
16 countries, split into 64 cities, 
treacherous weather conditions, rain, 
fog, and snow. You have the choice of 
any car, any car you like  as long as 
itÅfs the red one. The cars differ It looks like it could become the essential racing 
game for the SNES. Edge tracks it down 
internally, with only a choice of 
manual or automatic 
transmission to begin with, but 
as you progress and earn lots of ~ 
money, you buy different engines. 
Your car kicks off with a weedy 
V6 engine, but if you save up 
your money you can soon be the 
proud owner of a V12 monster  
capable of speeds over 200mph. 
The screen layout is similar to its 
predecessor, showing your speed, a 
map, and nitros. Incidentally this time 
your car comes equipped with five

with larger sprites, allowing you to see 
more of the action. The pitstops have 
been taken out because they were 
thought to have slowed down the 
original. Instead you have to collect 
fuel without stopping as you hurtle 
down the track  no easy task. 
There are points in the game where 
youÅfre driving blind up a hill and all of 
a sudden your car reaches the top and 
begins its stomach-churning decent. 
The undulating hills are very realistic 
and improve on the original no end. 
The various weather conditions affect 
the way the car performs  rain and 
icy conditions reduce traction, 
obviously making driving at 200mph a 
slightly risky occupation. 
Swerving through the night or fog 
is also very difficult: the other carsÅf 
rear lights are your only guide to stay 
on the road, as your vision is so badly 
impaired. The cars update smoothly

get to choose your engine (below) prescreen 
is highly polished. 
Two players can play 
simultaneously with the aid of the split 
screen, but the major difference 
centres around the oneplayer mode. 
Top Gear used the same split screen 
layout in oneplayer mode, but in the 
sequel you get a single screen. This 
gives the game much more of an 
arcade feel. 
Top Gear 2 basically uses the same 
animation routine as the original 
version, but the largest part of the 
cartÅfs memory is used to hold tables 
ÅeaboveÅf the game code. By doing this, 
instead of continually accessing the 
source code, the game can lift data 
straight from the table, thus speeding 
up the majority of calculations. 
Kemco have also used better 
compression routines and, according 
to one leading Top Gear 2 
programmer, they also discovered 
extra RAM that they didnÅft know 
existed, which has allowed for better 
use of playfields. 
Without doubt, the graphics have 
been improved, but they were never the 
gameÅfs selling point. What is 
important is the playability, and the 
version we played seemed fine, if a 
little sluggish. 
Due for release in November, 
Top Gear 2 is a sequel that has = 
been well worth the wait.

Thunderhawk was originally an

itÅfs got 45mins of CD space -a

The ingame graphics look great,

only drawback is the lack of colour  
the scenery is made up of just 16 
colours, so it can look a bit drab. 
So itÅfs graphically good, but what 
about the gameplay? ThunderhawkÅfs 
easy to get to grips with. You first 
carefully target the enemy using your 
radar, then select your armament: you 
have a choice of cannons, rockets and 
missiles. Missiles are set for auto lock- 
on, but the cannon and rockets have to 
be aimed manually. Then you just 
shoot the hell out of whatever you are 
targeting. When all the enemies have 
been destroyed, you head out of the 
combat area. And thatÅfs it.

impressive music, but itÅfs on CD so 
thatÅfs what youÅfd expect. Fully 
digitised speech warns you of incoming 
enemy missiles and tells you to Åeget the

tough. Although scratchy and in some 
places a bit unclear, the speech adds 
urgency and atmosphere to the game.

DID would say that  Epic was a game 
famed for not living up to its hype. It 
looked okay, but was too easy to 
complete and gave the impression of 
being unfinished, even though it was 
kept back months in development. TFX and Inferno are the latest 3D 
games from the partnership of 
Ocean and Digital Image Design. 
And, after last yearÅfs overhyped Epic, 
both companies have a lot to prove.

Many thought that DIDÅfs

releasing it before it was ready. With 
Inferno, DID claims itÅfs all different. 
As MD Martin Kenwright, 
explains, ÅeWith Epic there were so 
many things we wanted to do, but we 
just ran out of time.Åf 
By contrast, Inferno and TFX have 
been given all the time they need. And 
Inferno is claimed to be all that Epic 
should have been, but finally wasnÅft. 
The storyline is similar: ItÅfs set 90

Phillips  the artist on the Judge 
Dredd monthly  as the graphic artist. 
ÅeThe main idea of the game is to 
give the player the illusion of depth 
and authenticity on a large scaleÅf, says 
DIDÅfs Shaun Hollywood. In the whole 
game there are seven planets and three 
moons  and you have total freedom to 
go wherever you want in the universe. 
There are 130 missions in total. 
As Shaun explains; ÅeThere has been 
a lot of talk about some games being 
interactive movies, but theyÅfre 
generally rubbish. I wasnÅft trying to 
create a film-like game with Inferno  
it just turned out that way.Åf 
Inferno has very sharp 3D graphics 
and mind-blowing music. Flying 
through worlds and across space 
youÅfre presented with very smooth 3D 
images. All the out-of-game graphics 
were done in 3D Studio on the PC, but 
DID used its own 3D engine for 
ingame sequences. And while music for 
most games is just an afterthought, 
InfernoÅfs soundtrack was all part of 
the original idea. 
DID first tried to get in mainstream 
bands to record the music, but found 
them too unreliable. So OceanÅfs music 
man, Barry Leitch, called in the goth 
outfit, Alien Sex Fiend. 
It may seem a strange choice, but 
the Fiends (as theyÅfre known to their 
friends) are one of BarryÅfs favourite 
bands. He explains, ÅeWe were trying to 
create a film soundtrack, but not make 
it orchestral. Sex Fiend thought they'd 
be good at film music.Åf DID flew the

the higher you go, the redder 
it gets - so simple, but so 
very effective 
weeks to record all the music. 
While the Fiends come cheaper 
than most mainstream bands, it was 
still an expensive project. And the level 
of resources that were available for the 
game seems to be a bit of an issue at 
DID  in spite of the big-name backing 
from Ocean. According to Shaun, 
ÅeWith Inferno, we wanted to prove that 
you donÅft need infinitely deep pockets 
to produce games to compete with the 
big US companies.Åf 
Martin Kenwright is more direct: 
ÅeThe games industry could be 20 times 
ahead of where it is now, if it wasnÅft 
for marketing and financial directors 
saying we donÅft want to spend another

Meals on wheels: T-rex 
likes these crunchy 
things with the yammy 
soft centres electric fences on and off, collect 
various items and save the kids  all 
pretty standard stuff. However the 
game has been in development for the 
last 18 months, so this is no rush job. 
And rather than base the game on the 
slam-bang movie, Ocean have gone 
back to Michael CrichtonÅfs novel. 
ÅeAll the versions are based on the 
book,Åf explains OceanÅfs newly- 
appointed PR manager, Simon Altey. 
ÅeSpielberg had to get the action of the 
book into two hours and show lots of 
dinosaurs. We had to create a game 
that would give as much enjoyment as 
possible, for as long as possible. 
ÅgWe have the scene in the 
pterodactyl aviary and the triceratops 
stampede that wasnÅft in the film.Åf 
Of course, at more than a million 
dollars a minute for the computer 
generated effects, you can see why 
Spielberg maybe skipped a few 
chapters along the way. 
For Jurassic Park to have 
anything like the impact of the movie, 
the computer game had to be different, 
as programmer Andy Miah attests: 
ÅeThe original scenario had to be 
approved by Spielberg, and he had to 
see the game occasionally in 
development. One thing Spielberg 
didnÅft want was another straight shoot 
Ågem up or platform game.Åh 
Which is odd, because thatÅfs pretty 
much what Jurassic Park amounts to. 
ThereÅfs a 60-40 split of exterior 
adventure-strategy mixed with interior 
3D sections; but itÅfs all linked together 
by dinosaurs and their immediate 
extinction using a variety of heavy 
duty weaponry. 
The real advances have been 
SOSSCCOHS EHEC SH SHS OHHREEEHOEEBBES One innovation is stairways: you can climb 
up and see the velociraptors below you 
made with the Amiga and PC versions. 
A special 3D engine was developed on 
the PC to generate the fluid, filled 
vector graphics and provide total 
freedom of movement. Muted colours 
have been used to create a dark and 
eerie backdrop, and crank up the 
tension ready for your first encounter 
with the deadly velociraptors: the 
fastest, most dangerous dinosaurs in 
the entire park. Each raptor sprite 
contains 60 frames of animation to 
impart ultra-realistic movement and 
heighten the tension. 
These interior 3D sections are 
very Alien-esque: armed with motion 
scanner and the inevitable big gun, you 
end up stalking different buildings in a 
kill-or-be-killed scenario. Each 
location is spread over several floors 
allowing you to climb stairs and look 
down as the dreaded raptors scurry 
past beneath  an innovative touch. 
Likewise, programmer David 
Chiles outlined some of the graphical Inside 
As you wander around 
the park, youÅfll come 
across storage facilities 
and power sub-stations 
(opposite). Here the 
game changes from

You have to you explore 
the dimly-lit corridors and 
rooms, while avoiding the 
raptors who have taken 
up residence therein. The

clever raptors  they 
follow you around, learn 
your movement patterns 
and wait in hiding. With 
atmospheric visuals and 
a suitably eerie

sections should be the 
highlight of Jurassic Park. 
The 3D environment

OceanÅfs Super Nintendo 
game is being coded in 
the States, and looks like 
it will be the last version

has the same structure 
as the computer games, 
but is more of an arcade 
shoot 'em up. The 3D 
sections (opposite) 
include both raptors and 
also the brightly-coloured 
spitters. However, they 
have less intelligence 
than the PC and Amiga 
creatures and simply wait 
in rooms for you to find 
them, rather than follow 
you around.

velociraptors were only

around 12 feet. Some

adventuring, thereÅfs still a fair amount of gratuitous dino-violence 
Outside 
The outdoor sections of 
Jurassic Park follow the 
playerÅfs character as he 
traverses the park. The 
scenery moves smoothly in 
eight directions, a feature 
achieved using hardware 
scrolling  something of a 
technical feat on the PC and 
Amiga. The park contains 
lots of things to collect, 
places to go and puzzles to 
solve. The computer 
versions require a lot more 
strategy than the arcade- 
oriented SNES version. Most 
of the larger dinosaurs also 
have artificial intelligence, so 
that they recognise sounds 
and track them down. If you 
run around blasting at any- 
thing that moves, youÅfll soon 
find yourself with a large 
audience  certainly in size if 
not in numbers. techniques that were developed for the 
exterior sections: ÅeThe most important 
thing we've achieved is the hardware 
scrolling, which is very difficult to do 
correctly on the PC and Amiga; itÅfs 
been done before, but not successfully. 
ÅgWe've used a treble-buffered 
edge scroll: thereÅfs a megabyte of 
buffer, split into three areas, each 
bigger than the screen size. While you 
display one, youÅfll be writing to 
another; the third buffer has nothing 
drawn to it except the background  
everything behind the sprites  and the 
data for the edge of the screen is con- 
stantly updated to all three buffers. 
ÅeItÅfs complex because things get 
out of sync after a while, so you have 
to keep resynchronising  roughly once 
for every screenÅfs worth of scrolling. 
ÅeIt took three weeks to get it up 
and running, but there was a specific 
bug that was a real pain to get rid of. 
Unfortunately itÅfs the only way to get 
a decent arcade game on the PC, 
thereÅfs no other way of doing it: PC 
screen memory is a joke!Åf 
THX-approved cinemas  
like the Empire, Leicester Square  
show off the filmÅfs superb soundtrack 
and effects; and the game tries hard to 
follow in its oversize footprints. Andy Miah demonstrated the gameÅfs intro 
music: an atmospheric, sultry piece 
that sets the mood perfectly as the all- 
too-familiar Jurassic logo appears. 
ÅeWe mimicked the movieÅfs music, 
but itÅfs not sampled,Åf says Andy. 
ÅgHowever, we did manage to sample 
the T-rexÅfs scream straight into the 
game, and most of the animals have 
been digitised from the movie. ThereÅfs 
50K just for the sounds.Åf 
The ingame music is equally 
impressive, rapidly altering to suit the 
onscreen action  a feature which is 
becoming increasingly important in 
new software. 
So, as long as all the elements of 
the game gel together, it looks like 
Ocean can look forward to October 
1st, which is Jurassic  and _ 
judgement  day for the game.

ossibly KonamiÅfs most 
popular series to date 
is Castlevania, or the 
Legend Of Dracula as 
itÅfs known in Japan, 
and their commitment 
to multiple formats continues with the 
launch of new versions of Castlevania 
for the PC Engine CD, Mega Drive, 
and Super NES. 
The title of the Engine version is 
curiously blessed with an ÅeXÅf, rather 
like CapcomÅfs new Mega Man X game. 
To the untrained eye at least, it looks 
like itÅfs based on the first Castlevania 
game on the NES. But itÅfs infinitely 
better. In fact, if it matches the quality 
of KonamiÅfs other Engine releases, it 
should be another essential purchase. 
Together with the Mega Drive 
version, Vampire Killer, or prescreen 
Castlevania: Bloodlines as 
it'll be known over here, and 
the rumoured Castlevania V 
for the SNES, these games 
amount to nothing less than 
a fully-fledged vampire

quit the European home 
computer market, itÅfs 
interesting to note that theyÅfre still 
committed to the Japanese market, 
producing games for SharpÅfs X68000.

Was industry golden boy Hawkins 
trying to pull the wool over 
peopleÅfs eyes? 
the games industry. And he sold it 
just as hard and impressively as 
people had expected him to. 
Heads did indeed nod, jaws 
duly dropped and software

agreed that this looked like the 3DO wanted it to remain a secret, show. You fake it. Or simulate it. peasniesy boldly

MPEG 2 
3D0Åfs architecture is a mixture of 32-bit RISC processing supported by a Direct Memory Access engine for 
high-speed data movement, and a pair of custom animation engines that work independently of the CPU. 
These produce high-resolution images that can be warped and then lit from any direction. Impressed? 
The boldest .... 
3D0 have made, is that their 
hardware is Åe50 times faster 
than conventional 16-bit 
systemsÅf. And the strangest 
thing is, no-one seems to be 
questioning it; just believing it, 
and telling others theyÅfd better 
believe it too. But with 3D0 
skirting around the edges of 
technical details, a more just how powerful is 3D0? 
32-bit RISC processor 
The RISC (Reduced Instruct 
Set Computer) Central 
Processing Unit used in the 
3DO is called the ARM6 and 
Archimedes home computer. 
While the clock speed doesnÅf detailed analysis is the only way 
to put things in perspective. So 
has also been used in the Acorn sound much at 12-5MHz, itÅfs a 
true 32-bit chip and it will 
execute most instructions in 
one, sometimes two cycles. For 
a speed comparison, the ARM6 
in the 3DO is roughly equivalent 
to an Intel 486 running at 
33MHz. Pretty damn fast. 
There are some differences. For 
a start, a 486Åfs speed is 
hindered by things the 3DO just 
t won't have to think about. ion Things like a RAM cache, 
segment architecture, and 
having to run IntelÅfs 8088- 
compatibility code  all these 
have to be factored into speed. 
3D0Åfs RISC architecture allows 
it to streamline a lot of the 
things a 486 or any other 
Industry Standard Architecture 
(ISA)-based processor is 
burdened with. 
And whatÅfs more, 3D0Åfs got 
some nifty graphics hardware in 
the form of the twin cell 
engines. Now these are fast  
faster even than the 3D0Åfs 
RISC processor. 
As for that elusive Åe50 times 
fasterÅf factor, the 12:-5MHz 
clock speed of 3DO copes with 
about six million instructions 
per second  making it in raw 
numbers about six times faster 
than the SNES and Mega Drive 
CPU. Not 50 times faster. 
Animation processors 
The key to the systemÅfs high- 
performance architecture is a 
specialised pair of animation 
engines, that can, itÅfs claimed, 
display or move up to 64 
million pixels per second. 
ThatÅfs compared to the mere 
one million pixels per second 
average of 16-bit systems, and 
the three million pixels per 
second average of 32-bit 
systems. These engines organise 
the graphics into Åeanimation 
cellsÅf similar to the graphics 
engine in the Atari Lynx. 
3D0Åfs animation cells are 
high resolution, full colour 
images, that can be moved, 
scaled, rotated, warped, 
texture-mapped, lightsourced

manage to run something during 
the show were Åesingle-taskÅf 
machines running things like 
CinePak video demos. 
And it wasnÅft just 3DO who 
were cheating. Journalist Barry 
Fox describes the Panasonic stand 
at CES, ÅeA Panasonic player was 
running a car race game and the 
demonstrator told me it was a 
ÅeworkingÅf player. | pressed the Disc 
Eject button. There wasnÅft even a 
disc in the player tray. The wires 
from the joypads looked as if they 
went into the backs of the players. 
In fact, they went through holes in 
z a partition just behind the backs of 
3 D O the players. From there they ran to 
Apple Quadras.Åf After the CES Trip Hawkins 
insisted that Åethings were 
unfinished,Åf and when quizzed 
about the computers, he admitted 
that the demonstrations at Chicago 
had relied on Quadra development 
systems and on players capable of 
performing only single tasks. But he 
also stressed that the players 
shown at the CES did not contain 
the Åefinal chipsetÅf. But Panasonic in 
the US claimed the players were 
Åefinal prototypesÅf and ÅecompleteÅf, 
and only the program software had 
come from the hidden Quadras. 
The 3DO hardware was far 
from being finalised even by the 
time the Chicago CES took place 
back in June. And rather than 
showing towering stacks of computer hardware ÅesupportingÅf 
their unfinished little black boxes  
and thus potentially undermining all 
their surefire claims about the 
3DO system meeting its launch  
things got a little bit sneaky and 
underhand. Besides, very few

and even made transparent with 
the aid of 3D0Åfs Cinematic 
Software Tools. These cell 
engines draw the images while 
the RISC CPU calculates where 
the images are going. For pure 
polygon generation as seen in 
games like Starfox, and 
texture-mapped 3D as seen in 
things like Forgotten Castle, 
3DO is exceptionally fast. 
DMA Engine 
One of 3D0Åfs strongest features 
is its DMA engine. Direct 
Memory Access enables the 
system to shift around huge 
chunks of data within its three 
megabytes of memory without 
using the CPU. And 3D0 can do 
it faster than 16-bit technology. 
If youÅfre doing ÅenormalÅf 
DMA, 3D0 can move about 
six megabytes a second, 
compared to 2:6 megabytes a 
second on 16-bit, such as the 
SNES  two-three times faster. 
However, 3DO has something 
called ÅeSport DMAÅf which 
moves longwards in a cycle. 
This means that instead of the 
DMA moving data at 12:5 
megabytes a second, it moves at 
four times that  50 megabytes 
a second. 
In fact, this is the only 
equation with a 50 in it, and it 
still isnÅft 50 times faster than 
the DMA speeds of 16-bit 
technology, just 20 times.

Now, this is really misleading. 
On paper, 3DO claims that the 
system is capable of a 
resolution of 640x480 pixels. 
This just isnÅft true. 3DO only techview: multimedia 
I donÅft think itÅfs too earlyÅf says Trip Hawkins, CEO of The 3D0 Company. ÅeThe technology is good enough to 
take a sufficient leap forward at a reasonable price. | know itÅfs going to work.Åf For his sake, it had better... ber Teandenlains 
has a 320x240 video memory, 
not 640x480, but it is capable 
of looking like 640x480. The 
hardware cheats by comparing 
adjacent pixels and producing a 
new, intermediate pixel 
(horizontally and vertically) by 
averaging the two colours. If 
you have a black and white 
pixel next to one another, the 
new pixel would be grey. 
By anti-aliasing the pixels in 
this way, you end up witha 
smoother gradation between 
pixels, but itÅfs certainly not a true high-resolution screen. 
And, like the Amiga in 
interlace mode, the screen 
constantly flickers. This is 
negligible during play when 
there are loads of graphics 
moving about, but on text 
screens the effect is less than 
pleasant. Sadly, thereÅfs nothing 
you can do about it. 
Finally, the 3DO system also 
has the ability to take two 
separate pictures and fully 
interleave them to give stereo 
imaging for 3D glasses. So finally, the system 
is powerful  faster than a 486 
PC and way ahead of current 
16 or 32-bit technology. But 
without defining the 
benchmarks (things like 
processor speed or polygon 
generation), comparisons like 
Åe50 times fasterÅf are worse than 
pointless: they are misleading. 
3DO doesnÅft need this kind of 
number juggling and tricksy 
marketing. The truth is quite 
impressive enough. >

people bothered to ask any 
awkward questions. 
3 DO Is still scheduled for an 
October release but there are 
doubts about the companyÅfs 
chances of achieving it. In the 
words of one 3DO developer, ÅeIf 
The 3DO Company make their 
October deadline it will be a 
miracle, honestly. For it to ship in 
September, Panasonic should be 
manufacturing 3DOs now [and this 
was July]. You canÅft manufacture 
something that ainÅft finished.Åf 
And with the RAM being 
boosted from two to three 
megabytes in late July, the system 
was hardly what youÅfd call finished. Of course, 3DO remain resolute in 
their promise of the systemÅfs 
onsale date, ÅeWeÅfre throwing all 
the final switches and there will be 
machines in the market place in 
OctoberÅf, claims 3DO senior vice 
president of software, Bill Duvall. 
ÅeIt doesnÅft take three months to do 
the manufacturing and | think some 
of the concern has been about 
whether the chipset will be ready 
in time. The boxes will be on a 
boat shipping over in September.Åf 
Whether the system makes 
the deadline or not, a common 
view is held that the company has 
been far too ambitious within the 
machineÅfs tight development cycle. 
Some say they should have scaled 
things down a bit or given their hardware people another three to 
six months to really iron out the 
technical problems.

Stewart Bonn, in charge of 
CD-ROM development at EA 
s one of the most 
committed partners in 
= 3D0, Electronic Arts 
is taking 3DO very seriously. 
And with EAÅfs founder and 
ex-chief executive Trip 
Hawkins manning 3D0Åfs helm, 
EA is counting on big changes Close to the 3D0 building in 
sickeningly sunny San Mateo 
you'll find EAÅfs impressive HQ 
in the world of home 
entertainment. Edge spoke to 
Stewart Bonn, the man behind 
EAÅfs CD-ROM development. 
Edge Why did EA get involved 
with 3D0? 
Stewart Bonn ÅeTrip Hawkins 
and some other EA people 
decided to sponsor a research 
and development project to 
come up with a new product, 
and in particular, a potential 
hardware standard. We met the 
New Technologies Group, 
who were also keen for a new 
hardware standard, and it took 
off from there.Åf 
Edge So how do you think 3D0 compares to other CD systems? 
SB ÅeThe jury is still out on 
whether a CD drive attached to 
some of these other systems is 
really comparable to playing 
from RAM and hard drives, or 
in the case of consoles, froma 
cartridge. But I certainly 
haven't seen anything on the 
Mega CD that says ÅeBuy meÅf. 
*3D0 addresses a lot of the 
typical CD access problems by 
including a double-speed CD 
drive, and weÅfre counting on 
the architecture of 3D0Åfs 
hardware to make the most of 
the storage ability of CD-ROM.Åf 
Edge So whatÅfs EAÅfs approach 
to the 3D0 hardware? 
SB Åe3D0Åfs so damn fast that 
there are a bunch of things that 
you can do to create motion 
and interesting things on the 
screen to offset the need to 
stream video off the CD. I think 
weÅfre going to have the sort of 
gameplay that videogame 
players really like, and not the 
sluggish stop-start gameplay 
that CD seems to give on other 
systems. WeÅfre reinventing 
technology in many ways. 
ÅeThe stuff we're doing on 
3DO has seen a complete 
demolition of all previous 
techniques. For example, we've 
had to completely rethink the 
way football and other sports 
work onscreen  and the way 
rendering happens in games like 
Shock Wave is completely 
unique.Åf 
Edge But 3D0 still hasnÅft got 
high-quality full-motion video 
as standard. Surely there are 
problems only having MPEG 
technology as an option? Road Rash on 3D0. A far cry 
from the relatively barren 
Mega Drive version 
SB ÅeI think MPEG in itself is a 
problem, as it offers something 
that no one really needs in the 
games market. ItÅfs good kit but 
it does nothing for gameplay.Åf 
Edge But 3D0 does have 
CinePak. Will you be using that 
to create movie-style effects? 
SB ÅeYes, we will be using 
CinePak, but sparingly. For 
example, in John Madden 
Footbal! on 3DO you'll see a lot 
of video, but itÅfs only in bits of 
digitised commentary used for 
effect. We're not that 
impressed with CinePak, so, 
wherever we can, we'll be 
photo-composing scenes, 
instead of using video streamed 
off the CD. 
ÅeUsing photorealistic images 
on both backgrounds and 
foregrounds, and animating 
them separately with the 
hardware, we get a far superior 
effect to just running the whole 
thing through CinePak.Åf 
Edge Will your commitment to 
3DO be affecting your support 
for other systems? 
SB ÅeNo. ThatÅfs part of the 
reason why all our 3DO stuff is 
achieved with additional

One of EAÅfs biggest-selling titles to be transferred from existing 
platforms is PGA Tour Golf. This oneÅfs likely to be a big seller on 3D0 - 
even if it does look surprisingly like PhilipsÅf tedious golf game on CD-i 
mainly as an instrument of 
comparison for weighing up the 
new technology against the old. 
The 3DO version of Road 
Rash uses hi-res 24-bit art to 
set the scene for the game, and 
has preliminary graphics that look nice enough, if a little 
lacking in colour and detail. 
Huge buildings scroll past in a 
similar fashion to a Sega 
coin-op (though not nearly as 
smoothly), but some evidence of Park Place ProductionsÅf excellent 
John Madden Football has been 
transferred onto 3D0 by EA 
unconvincingly. 
The only other 3D0 game 
Edge played at EA was Shock 
Wave, a 3D space shoot Åfem 
up. ItÅfs entirely new, and uses 
photorealistic graphics and an 
excellent 3D texture-mapped 
terrain. Unfortunately, the 
price paid for such realistic 
graphics is high  you get a 
sloppy frame rate  and the 
only impressive bit in the game 
is the excellent Return Of The 
Jedi-style walkers that stomp 
around the screen. 
3D0Åfs power is certainly there. 
What wasnÅft there in the 
version Edge looked at was 
decent sprite manipulation  
the cars and bikes jerked 
around the screen rather This oneÅfs not expected to 
appear until February at the 
earliest, so it looks like EA will 
be hedging its bets with one of 
its popular sports titles when 
the 3D0O system actually 
appears in October. ve

company that produces the glue 
used in a good chunk of the 
worldÅfs supply of RAM chips, burnt 
down recently, drastically cutting 
the supplyline of RAM chips to 
many large computer companies. 
Despite MatsushitaÅfs status as 
the worldÅfs hugest consumer 
electronics company, people are 
suggesting the price of RAM might 
soar dramatically, possibly even 
affecting the retail price of 
PanasonicÅfs machine, now budgeted 
for an extra megabyte of memory. 
Watch this space. 
Dodging all of the 
development and manufacturing 
hiccups, suppose  just suppose 
3DO does make October after all. 
Who are the first consumers to subscribe to this vision going to be? 
At $700, thereÅfs hardly going to be 
a stampede, and Trip Hawkins 
knows it. He sees the first 500,000 
buyers as the early innovators, or 
pioneers of technological 
oneupmanship. 
ÅeWhenever you get a big jump 
in performanceÅf, says Hawkins, 
Åehalf a million people will buy it no 
matter what you do in terms of 
marketing and support. Look at the 
Atari ST,Åf he says, ÅeAtari did 
everything wrong and they still sold 
half a million. Look at the 
Commodore 64. It was seen at the 
time as a games machine. In 1993

Crystal DynamicsÅf HQ in Palo Alto, California (top) is now home to CEO 
Strauss Zelnick (bottom left), ex-president of Twentieth Century Fox. 
Pictured bottom right is Crystal DynamicÅfs Scott Steinburg (centre) 
with 3DO programmers Mark Cerny (left) and Eric Knopp (right) _o established games 
ompanies are bold 
nough to concentrate 
their efforts entirely on 3D0  
but Crystal Dynamics  a 
Silicon valley start-up software 
company  is doing just that. 
Considering Crystal Dynamics 
is so small and has yet to 
launch a single game, theyÅfre 
generating lots of interest. And 
it chiefly surrounds their new 
president, Strauss Zelnick, 
who now heads their team of 30 
in-house 3DO game designers 
and programmers. 
35 year-old Zelnick is the 
ex-president and chief of 
operations at Twentieth 
Century FoxÅfs film unit: he 
leaves behind him 1,200 
employees and a division with 
annual revenue close to $2 
billion. His previous salary was 
reputed to be $1 million a year. 
For a fledgling company like 
Crystal Dynamics, this is a 
move of major significance, and 
it shows outsiders how seriously 
Hollywood is taking the $5 
billion US games industry. 
Quizzed about his move by 
the Wall Street Journal, 
Zelnick replied: ÅeI donÅft want to 
sound like IÅfm some 
trendsetter, but I know there 
will be others. ThereÅfs just too 
much opportunity out there.Åf 
Zelnick believes that the 
cutting edge of entertainment 
lies with new technologies like 
3D0. And heÅfs prepared to put 
his career on the line to prove 
it. As a further testament to 
this longterm commitment, 
Crystal Dynamics will be developing only for 3DO until 
other suitable (ie 32 or 64-bit) 
platforms appear. 
But Zelnick also knows 
about the other side of the 
Åeinteractive entertainmentÅf 
coin. His involvement with the 
interactive multimedia arm of 
Twentieth Century Fox left him 
cynical about the more 
grandiose Hollywood plans for 
interactive media. ÅeStorytelling 
isnÅft by nature interactive,Åf he 
says. ÅeIt needs a teller anda 
listener, and the teller doesnÅft 
ask people, Åedo you want the 
princess to die or not?Åh 
Zelnick agrees that thereÅfs 
still much to be achieved with 
interactive games. The creative 
side of the games market is still 
Åeat the stage of the Keystone 
CopsÅf, he believes. Videogames 
need a ÅevernacularÅf, he argues, 
Åesomething that movies have 
had since the 1930sÅf. 
But what does the future 
hold for one of HollywoodÅfs 
youngest big-timers? Zelnick, 
ever confident, leaves the 
games industry with a 
challenge: ÅeWe are looking for 
people to participate in what we 
believe will be a $20 billion 
entertainment business  itÅfs 
going to be as big as the whole 
movie business worldwide.Åf 
But how. 
is such a small 
new company capable of 
making such a loud noise? And, 
more importantly, why is the 
industry taking notice? 
Perhaps it has something to 
do with the companyÅfs

$700. IÅfm not interested 
in machines over $500Åf 
Tom Kalinske, President, Sega USA should have adopted), and 
Laserdisc, which despite a recent 
revival, was always too expensive 
to be a mainstream alternative. 
And naturally, its competitors 
are quick to suggest that the 3DO 
system is firmly planted in the same 
premium soil. Especially at $700.

company that engineered 3DO 
hardware alongside Electronic 
Arts. Or the fact that theyÅfve 
also managed to recruit some 
top industry talent for both 
game design and marketing. 
Realistically, itÅfs probably 
got just as much to do with the 
fact that they out-performed 
other 3DO developers at the 
Summer CES by demonstrating 
the two best-looking 3D0 
games yet seen  Crash ÅenÅf 
Burn and Total Eclipse. 
Crystal DynamicsÅf Scott 
Steinburg explains, ÅeWeÅfre 
taking a Hollywood approach in 
our products and trying to 
incorporate lots of basic 
cinematography skills into our techview: multimedia 
Crash ÅfnÅf Burn, Crystal DynamicÅfs first 3D0 game, is an excellent 
showpiece for the new hardware. The scenery and scaling effects are 
impressive, if a tad jerky. Still, you canÅft have everything When finished, Crash ÅfnÅf Burn will 
include multiple weapon systems 
and a racing circuit where cars 
can be upgraded 
gameplay. The last thing we 
want to do is create games that 
are just a lot of window 
dressing  like Night Trap on 
the Sega CD.Åf 
Window dressing or not, the companyÅfs first titles will be 
major catalysts for shifting 
3DO systems. Crash ÅenÅf Burn, a 
sort of kill-or-be-killed version 
of Virtua Racing with guns, 
missiles and explosions, will be CrystalÅfs first game and will 
appear at the same time as the 
Panasonic 3DO unit itself. 
ItÅfs basically a Mad Max- 
style racing game packed with 
impressive texture-mapped 
visuals, and with a choice of 
two perspectives  in and 
outside the car. ThereÅfs none of 
that incredible Virtua Racing- 
style eye-in-the-sky stuff, but 
even 3DO has its limits. 
Crash ÅenÅf Burn is still a very 
impressive attempt at a fast 
action game, and includes a 
selection of exciting and diverse 
tracks. It also promises loads of 
new features to come. 
Total Eclipse is different. 
ItÅfs a space combat simulator 
and is even more impressive 
than Crash ÅfnÅf Burn. If youcan >

early innovators as he hopes toÅf, 
says NintendoÅfs Bill White, Åethat 
gives a market '/ioth to '/oth the 
size of either Sega or NintendoÅfs 
installed base.Åf 
Ah, but if 3DOÅfs $500 target 
price materialises, and 3DO are 
saying it will when other 
manufacturers such as Sanyo and 
AT&T enter the market, then Bill 
will have to do some more sums. 
Oh, and he just might have to 
budge over a bit, too. 
In total over 300 software 
companies, including talented 
development houses such as 
Origin, Argonaut and Bullfrog, have signed up to develop games 
for 3DO. And thatÅfs before a single 
3DO machine has even been 
unboxed. So what lured them? 
Why was this one party they just 
couldnÅft afford to miss? 
Well, the reasons are 
twofold. First, it is virtually free. 
Only a few hundred dollars, in fact, 
is all that it takes to become a 
3DO developer. With such a small 
entrance fee, thereÅfs inevitably a lot 
of window shopping going on. Few 
companies are committing 
themselves straight away, and most 
will wait and see if the system 
really takes off before ploughing 
funds into game development. But 
the browsing isnÅft taking very long 
in some cases. ÅeMany companies adopted a 
waitsee approach nine months to a 
year ago. One of the things weÅfve 
noticed since then is that most 
didnÅft wait very long,Åf claims 3DOÅfs Namco Co Ltd,

 IÅfve found hardware problems 
that they didnÅft even know 
about, which means thereÅfs a 
slim chance that they wonÅft be

going for it is the number of

to get signed up. This just about 
guarantees success. 
ÅeBut I can tell you right now, 
out of that long list, only about 
20 companies are currently 
developing software. The rest 
are waiting to see what happens. 
If it doesnÅft take off, these 
companies only lose the licence

ÅeBesides, if 3DO make their

miracle. For the system to ship

something that simply isnÅft

ÅeThe guys at 3DO are trying 
hard to give developers what

my opinion. They should have 
scaled things down to get the 
system out this soon.Åf 
Edge If it ships in October, 
should people pay $700 for it? 
BH ÅeAsk me that question next The speed of the animation in 
OOTW is faster than on the SNES

will be lucky to have anything 
more than three or four games

heavy-weight believers in this 
pre-cooked bundle of promises 
are currently transferring 
Jurassic Park to 3D0 for MCA 3D0Åfs in-house development team that itÅfs hard to see how it can fail. 
Gamesplayers want the jump 
in performance, the industry needs 
a standard, and software compa- 
nies need a mainstream platform 
that isnÅft restrictive to publish for. 
But there are two things that may 
yet spoil the party. 
@ Expectations Remember 
when the Amiga replaced the 
Commodore 64 back in the late 
eighties? The tenfold jump in 
performance, though major by 
existing standards, wasnÅft enough 
to handle the colour graphics at 
the same speed as on the C64. And 
much of the software was a 
letdown because programmers 
were taking on too much. 
3DOÅfs hugely powerful and you'll see some stunning games for 
sure, but unless programmers scale 
their ideas down, gamesplayers are 
going to be bitterly disappointed by 
the trade-off in speed... 
@ Interaction ... And they're 
going to be even more 
disappointed by the lack of 
interactivity. 3DO may offer 
enhanced graphics and more 
realistic playing environments, but 
game design could be dire. 
Interactive movies are tedious; 
gameplay sucks. 3DO designers 
and programmers must look to 
involve people, not merely 
entertain them. 
Can Trip turn his 3DO dream 
into three-dimensional reality? _ 
Stay with Edge and see.

Jez San 
Argonaut Software Photograph: Rob Scott 
Jez San: founder and MD of 
Argonaut Software in the UK 
rgonaut Software is a leading 
UK software house, famous for 
many reasons, among them its 
commitment to 3D  3D games, 3D chips 
for videogames, and now 3D sound. The 
company was started by then-schoolboy 
Jez San just over 11 years ago. He talks 
to Edge about the sound of things to 
come at Argonaut. 
Edge What does Dolby Surround add to 
King ArthurÅfs World? 
JS ÅeIn King Arthur's World you can pull 
up a sound menu and play effects, with 
some coming from the rear and some 
from the front, depending on what sounds 
they are. Like explosions and thunder and 
people falling, that kind of stuff is in 
Surround, and then some things like 
swordfight clashes come from the front, 
because theyÅfre on the screen. The nicest 
thing is the fanfare when you press reset  
the first thing it plays when it says King 
ArthurÅfs World presented in Dolby 
Surround  it plays a chord and it spins it 
around the room; it gradually pans it to 
the rear speaker and then back to the 
front again all around you.Åf 
Edge How far is Argonaut going to go 
with Dolby Surround? 
JS ÅeWe're doing more Surround sound 
stuff in all our future games. Now that we 
know how to do it, it doesnÅft take that 
much time to add it, so we might as well 
do it for every product. WeÅfve done some 
games for THQ  weÅfre doing a version of 
Ren & Stimpy for them on the SNES, and 
that will have it... and we have some 
other products as well.Åf 
Edge What about putting Surround ina 
game like Starfox? 
JS ÅeI think that would be a good game to 
use it in  itÅfs best for anything where you 
want things happening behind you...Åf 
Edge Like where you get overtaken by the King ArthurÅfs World on the SNES uses 
Dolby Surround for effects like thunder 
first end-of-level guardian? 
JS ÅeExactly, because you would hear it 
coming from behind you before it gets to 
the front. It would actually help the 
gameplayer out because you'd get an 
audio cue as to which direction the enemy 
was coming from, which you couldnÅft get 
with a simple stereo setup.Åf 
Edge What are the other benefits of 
Surround sound for gamesplayers? 
JS ÅeWell, one big advantage if youÅfve got 
a full Dolby Pro-Logic setup, is that it is 
very good for all CD games, because you 
can get the vocal track to come from the 
centre speaker, which gives you much 
more intelligible speech than if you have 
the speech coming out of only one speaker 
and the music coming out of all the 
others. It just makes everything in the 
game a lot easier to understand. In CD 
games where you have a lot of speech, 
thatÅfs a really good move.Åf 
King ArthurÅfs World runs on the SNES 
and gives you power over King Arthur and 
his knights in their battle against evil. 
After the opening fanfare, the 
Surround effects are generally quite 
subtle: thunder rumbles in the distance 
far behind you and flying arrows swish 
around your head. 
At first sight, it looks a lot like 
Lemmings and thereÅfs a high degree of 
problem-solving and trap-crossing to be 
completed. Utilising the different skills of 
each character in the right place, you slay 
the monsters that you meet, you defuse 
the traps and finally bust into each castle 
so that King Arthur can kill the chief 
villain on that level. 
There are 27 levels and the challenge 
isnÅft so much in defeating the end-of-level 
bad guys, as in reaching them without 
getting killed. Sadly, the game isnÅft very 
hard and is soon completed.

onscreen, but like in real life you can hear 
it faintly and tell where itÅfs coming from. 
Fire off a shot in the right direction and 
you might hit it; wait until itÅfs in front of 
you and you might be dead. As missiles 
leave your ship and scream off the screen, 
you hear them until theyÅfre out of range. 
Sound, like graphics, can be used as a 
tool to increase the depth of the gameplay, 
and judging by the earliest examples of 
Dolby Surround, itÅfs the way things will be 
moving in future. 
The principles , .,._. 
Surround sound arenÅft too complex. 
DolbyÅfs big trick is that it has figured out a 
way of cramming the four tracks needed 
for Dolby Stereo (left, right, centre and 
surround) into two  creating the Dolby 
4:2 Matrix system. Out the other end of 
the Matrix encoder comes a stereo 
recording with all the information required 
to recreate the four channels of sound, but 
remaining listenable in simple stereo. 
It works by merging the centre and 
surround channels with the left and right 
channels as a 90Åã out-of-phase signal, only 
perceptible to equipment tuned to look for 
it and separate it out. The extra channels 
are recovered by noting the difference 
between the L and R channels and having 
elements present in the signals cancel each 
other out. This means that nothing in the 
centre speakers leaks into the surround 
speakers, and vice versa. 
There are three basic types of system 
 Dolby Surround, Pro-Logic, and THX. 
Basic Surround units are what they call 
passive, where the centre speaker usually 
used in the middle of the setup at the front 
is absent, replaced by a phantom speaker 
simulating a centre channel. Pro-Logic

QSound is a 
major part of 
Jurassic Park: 
a footfall to 
the left means 
that right is a 
good direction 
to head 
systems are active, meaning that they 
constantly sense and enhance the dominant 
channel of the five or six speakers you can 
connect. Both systems produce the Dolby 
Surround effect, and envelope you in the 
sound, although Pro-Logic systems are 
better as they have a special steering 
mechanism to ensure better separation and 
therefore much more sharply focused 3D 
sound. THX units, which are approved by 
Lucasfilm, are just coming out now and 
although they employ basically the same 
system as the other two, they are 
technically leagues ahead  and cost more. 
But thereÅfs more than just Dolby 
Surround out there at the moment. SegaÅfs 
choice of sound system is called QSound 
and you'll hear it in several upcoming 
releases for the Mega CD. You'll soon be 
able to immerse yourself in the ambient 
aurals of Ecco The Dolphin and, of course, 
this yearÅfs big smash Jurassic Park, due for 
release this summer. Sound is a major part 
of Jurassic Park: the dinosaurs tramp around 
you in full QSound  so when you hear a 
footfall to the left, you'll know that right is 
a good direction to head. 
ItÅfs not yet known for sure if QSound 
technology can be incorporated into game 
cartridges, and hardware restrictions on 
carts are currently fairly limiting for full 
sound imaging. Anyway, itÅfs much easier to 
use QSound on CD, as it was originally 
designed for use in studio recording. 
When QSound was first developed, by 
Archer Communications of Canada, they 
offered it to Nintendo for videogame use, 
but Nintendo rejected it because they 
didnÅft think it was good enough. Others 
werenÅft as picky: QSound now features 
heavily in CapcomÅfs arcade games, and Sega 
has licensed it. Other firms like Philips

Chris Hiilsbeck: the man 
behind the music in Turrican 
hris Hiilsbeck is the 25 year-old 
German musician responsible for 
the great Surround sound 
included in Super Turrican on the Super 
NES. Since the early days of the C64, 
Chris has moulded a career producing 
game music for a variety of home 
computers and consoles, and has earned 
one of the best reputations in the 
industry, producing high quality music 
and effects in Amiga games like Turrican 
Tand IJ, and Apidya. 
In fact, the music has been so popular 
in these titles that Chris was encouraged 
to release music CDs incorporating the 
soundtracks. To date, theyÅfve sold around 
15,000 copies in Germany alone. (To find 
out more, call: 010 49 (610) 352365.) 
Edge talked to Chris about Super 
Turrican, Dolby Surround and the 
possibilities for sound in games. 
Edge Why did you decide to use Dolby 
Surround in Super Turrican? 
CH ÅeWe knew how Surround sound 
worked a long time before starting the 
Super Turrican project, and the 
possibility of including this process arose 
from my work on the Super NES sound 
hardware. Because I was working with 
such a small amount of memory I thought 
it would be a great idea to enhance the 
music and effects with Surround sound. 
And itÅfs been very well received.Åf 
Edge How easy is it to create the effect 
on the SNES? 
CH ÅeItÅfs not as tricky as you might think, 
but we sold our souls to get the reference 
material for the SNES so I canÅft reveal 
any technical details at this stage. 
However, the Dolby Surround sound 
signal is encoded in stereo so you canÅft 
hear it on a mono amplifier or monitor. 
ThatÅfs the reason the game offers mono 
mode in the menu.Åf SNES Super Turrican employs Dolby 
Surround for some brilliant spatial effects 
Edge What restrictions did a four 
megabit cartridge place on the sound 
quality in Super Turrican? 
CH: ÅeOut of the cartÅfs tiny 512K memory, 
only 128K is used for sound. This is 
about the same as the memory used by 
two of the 20+ Apidya soundtracks on the 
Amiga. The sound quality suffers on 
Super Turrican as a result; I could have 
achieved much more with extra memory.Åf 
Edge Can surround sound be done on 
other machines such as the Mega Drive, 
Amiga or PC? 
CH ÅeOn the Mega Drive the technique 
canÅft be used systematically, but my 
sound decoder often moves around FM 
sounds in the background so IÅfm 
searching for a way to control it. On the 
Amiga it is actually possible but it takes 
over two of the four channels just for one 
sound, so I wonÅft be using it very often. 
On the PC it is possible with the right 
sound card  the only one that can do it 
at a reasonable price is the Gravis 
Ultrasound card, and we are already 
working on a complex sound driver that 
will support it.Åf 
Edge What projects have you been 
working on recently? 
CH ÅeI spent a week converting CoreÅfs 
Jaguar XJ220 soundtracks onto the 
SNES working in 256K, based on the 
game being an eight meg cart. 
Unfortunately, after I finished them, the 
gameÅfs ROM had to be halved to four 
megabits so I had to redo them all in 
128K. Now thatÅfs over IÅfm working on 
the music for Super Turrican II, which 
will give me much more space to play 
around with since itÅfs currently scheduled 
for a 12 meg cart. IÅfm also planning my 
next CD release, which will be a 
collection of music from both Super 
Turrican and the all-new Mega Turrican 
on the Mega Drive.Åf E66T 1990100 oulzesew Seyagay

Tommy Tallarico: cutting 
tracks in QSound for Virgin 
o what about QSound? Does the 
technology exist in the games 
market to take advantage of this 
revolutionary sound system? Companies 
like Capcom and Sega obviously think so. 
While CD naturally provides greater 
scope for producing the effect, chip 
generated QSound can be heard in 
CapcomÅfs newer arcade games like Street 
Fighter Turbo, and Cadillacs And 
Dinosaurs. ThereÅfs a far greater depth to 
the music and sound effects and, of 
course, the natural positioning of the 
player between the cabinet speakers is 
perfect for the effect to work. 
Sega is approaching things froma 
different angle by incorporating QSound 
in many of its forthcoming Mega CD 
games. Ecco The Dolphin is the first 
game to take advantage of the process, 
and while in danger of being criticised as 
yet another rehashed CD release with no 
noticeable differences from the cartridge 
version, itÅfs at least doing something 
different in the sound department. 
Archer Communications, the company 
responsible for the development of 
QSound, is partly owned by Capcom. 
Besides Capcom, Virgin Games of Irvine, 
California, claims to be the first games 
company to have signed a deal with them 
for use of QSound in videogames. Edge 
spoke to Tommy Tallarico, head 
musician at Virgin Games USA. 
Edge Why did Virgin Games decide to 
invest in QSound? 
TT ÅeTo be honest, the reasons largely 
stem from my loathing of conventional 
videogame music. One of the things IÅfve 
attempted to do here at Virgin is change 
the way people hear and the way they feel 
about videogame music, by giving players 
the kind of music in their games that 
theyÅfd like to listen to normally. QSound Ecco The Dolphin - the first Mega CD 
release to get a QSound music track 
simply adds another dimension and allows 
for more variety in videogame sound.Åf 
Edge WhatÅfs your first QSound project? 
TT ÅeTerminator CD for the Sega CD is 
the first Virgin game to make use of 
QSound. To fit in with feel of the license, 
I went for hard rock stuff, rather like Van 
Halen without lyrics, in fact. All the 
music was recorded dry at first. That is, 
without reverbs or digital delays, and 
then I went to an A&M studio in 
Hollywood to mix down the whole set of 
tracks in QSound, in exactly the same 
way that it was be done for the QSound 
albums by Sting and Roger Waters. 
ÅgIn the studio the equipment lets you 
direct the QSound in any direction with a 
joystick. You'll notice this effect 
particularly in bits like the Techno bar 
scene in the game. You'll also recognise 
the music and voices in the game tune, as 
they were sampled directly from the 
movie in QSound. Capital Records are 
releasing the gameÅfs soundtrack on CD, 
too. Naturally, the cost of producing this 
kind of music is far more than usual, but 
the quality more than pays for itself.Åf 
Edge How do you feel QSound compares 
to Surround sound? 
TT ÅeWell, you wonÅft get the full range of 
depth that a six speaker Dolby Surround 
setup can provide, but itÅfs an impressive 
demonstration of what two speakers can 
deliver. The drawback is that it only 
works when the listener is positioned right 
in the centre of the speaker projection.Åf 
Edge How about QSound on a cartridge? 
TT ÅeWell, IÅfm experimenting with 8 or 
16-bit samples, for the sound effects that 
go alongside the CD QSound music. ItÅfs 
still very much a learning process and I 
think that hardware restrictions will 
determine whatÅfs possible. The better 
soundcards that are available for the PC 
do offer these possibilities.Åf

PC soundboard with QSound and synthesis 
from E-Mu sample/wave music chips. 
QSound is based on the same 
principles as several other sound systems: 
itÅfs psychoacoustic. There are four major 
factors that give your brain information as 
to where sound is coming from. The first 
one is the timing difference between one 
ear hearing a sound and the other hearing 
it. The second is the actual shape of the 
outer ear  this plays with the sound 
before it hits your inner ear, so your brain 
learns to recognise your ear shape and use 
it to identify sound. ThereÅfs also the 
filtering  your head and your hair and 
your body actually filter sound: so a sound 
coming from the left of you, would go 
directly into the left ear, but would be 
affected by the shape of your body before 
it gets to your right ear. 
All those factors combine to give your 
brain clues as to where the sound is. 
QSound uses these psychoacoustic 
principles, producing what is called binaural 
sound, but it also goes further, and changes 
it to transaural sound, which means that it 
works on a stereo speaker system. 
Another aural imaging system, 
RolandÅfs RSS (Roland Sound System), also 
does the same thing as QSound  RSS was 
used in the CDTV version of Xenon 2, 
which used a remix of Tim SimenonÅfs 
Bomb The Bass track, called Megablast. 
Putting together a simple 
soundtrack in QSound and RSS is fairly 
easy with the right equipment. You use a 
box with a bunch of DSPÅfs (Digital Sound 
Processors) in it, into which you feed a

sound source  any sound like a trumpet 
playing or an explosion. The sound is taken 
in as a mono input, and then you use the 
dials on the equipment to position the 
sound up and down, left and right. Once 
you've encoded your sound effects or 
instruments in 3D you can lay as many 
instruments as you want on top of each 
other, each with its own positional cues. 
But how do QSound and Dolby 
Surround compare? The big problem with 
QSound and RSS is that you have to be in 
the perfect position in the room  the 
sweet spot of the speakers  to get the 
best effect. Another drawback is that it 
isnÅft easy to position sounds behind you  
because thereÅfs only two speakers, the 
sound bounces around the walls of the 
room. So itÅfs not as perfect as if you were 
listening to it on headphones, for example. 
The best that QSound gives most 
people is a slightly wider stereo sound 
image, like the speakers are a bit further 
apart than normal. Although it does go 
some way to improving the 3D sensation, a 
proper Dolby Surround setup is much 
more effective because thereÅfs a genuine 
rear speaker. If the soundscape is targeted 
behind you, thereÅfs no confusion about it  
itÅfs definitely coming from behind. 
So, do you need to get tooled up for 
Dolby Surround to deal with the next wave 
of games? Well no, perhaps not the next 
wave, but sound technology in videogames 
is developing fast. And anyway itÅfs not just 
games that'll have the sounds to match 
your system. Films on video and TV 
programmes like Star Trek: The Next 
Generation and Northern Exposure 
already come with Surround soundtracks. 
You probably spent Åí500 on carts or 
software last year, and thatÅfs all itÅfll = 
cost to get started. So why wait? Photography: Peter Canning techview: sound 
or the full effect of Dolby Surround you need 
some kind of decoder. These come in two 
varieties (ignoring the shockingly expensive 
THX): you have the standard Dolby Surround, and the 
superior Dolby Surround with Pro-Logic. 
You can either get a hifi separate, called an AV 
Amplifier, or now you can get a number of TV sets with 
the technology built in. All the units require that you 
have at least two front speakers and two rear effects 
speakers for Surround to work properly. 
The table on the right contains all the highest-rated 
Dolby Surround equipment available at the moment: 
certainly the bigscreen TVs are excellent value. Surround sound the easy way:

Director and second unit cameraman of the Microcosm movie: intro man Jim Bowers (left), and 4 
vein designer Neil Thompson (right), outside PsygnosisÅf headquarters in Merseyside, Liverpool 
JB ÅeIt was actually NeilÅfs idea: we were 
having a brainstorming session, and the old 
Åeinside the bodyÅf films sprang to mind. We 
did the initial design work and graphics on 
the Amiga, and then we got the Silicon 
Graphics machines.Åf 
Edge What made you choose Silicon Graphics workstations? 
JB ÅeWell the Amiga can do most things that 
the rendering software can do, but the 
Indigo is just so much faster. ItÅfs designed 
around a dedicated graphics system, but 
can do many other things. We use the 
same software as the computer-generated ÅeJust one image

Jim Bowers, lead visualiser 
TV commercials, and films like The 
Lawnmower Man.Åf 
Edge Presumably then you need a lot of 
storage space? 
JB ÅeWith Microcosm we're talking gigabytes. 
One of these images can take a full 
megabyte for just one frame  we're talking 
16 million colours. The box cover was 
generated using 3D models on the Silicon 
Graphics and the finished single image took 
about 35 megabytes. 
ÅeWe had a file server with lots of hard 
disks strung together; | think in the end we 
had about six gigabytes.Åf 
Edge That's a hell of a lot of memory! 
JB ÅeYeah, one of the main things about CD 
is the scale: for instance, Microcosm 
probably contains more computer graphics 
than any feature film ever made! And it was 
done in the same time with less people.Åf 
Edge How do you create the 3D graphics? 
JB ÅeA lot of the vehicles you see in the 
game  the hunter-killer, the spacesuit, the 
hoverpod  were built a while ago on the 
computer in 3D. We generate each form 
like you would in an Amiga package, but 
thereÅfs more to it than that: you have to 
model everything, apply textures and test it 
all the time to see if it looks okay.

most fun: all the limbs articulate. | also built 
the end-of-level guardian creatures, based

about half of them and Paul Franklin

street, something thatÅfs recognisable, and 
itÅfs really hard to do. You stick a couple of 
buildings in and suddenly realise they have 
to be lit in a certain way. And then you 
stick more buildings in, and it just gets 
more and more complex. 
ÅeAnother hard part was the rooftop 
sequences: filling a rooftop which is meant techview: CD-ROM 
How 3D is rendered in | 
Step one: A linear display of the 3D 
model is produced in wireframe form, 
showing the construction lines of the 
helicopter. This basic graphic can be 
manipulated in real-time, allowing the 66T 1990100 oulzesew Sepggay 
to be flat, making it look busy. ThatÅfs quite artist to work out his animation routines 
a tricky one: the detail you put on it, 
deciding what to do, what to leave off. | 
tried to make it look fairly functional, then | 
fit the people within it that way.Åf 
Edge How did you manage to include 
footage of real people? 
JB ÅeWe filmed some of the team against 
bluescreen. A lot of time was spent building 
props and doing all the costumes: John 
Harris did some uniforms for us. That 
took about three weeks. Then we spent a 
week just filming, going through different 
lighting set-ups. 
ÅeIt was quite exciting. We had to do it 
at night as well; we were doing it in an 
office with windows everywhere and there 
was no way we could do it during daytime. 
ÅeWe recorded onto tape using a 
S-VHS camcorder. You select a bit you 
think will be useful, grab it and put it 
through our custom-written image 
processor that extracts a transparency 
mask on the colour blue. Then you 
composite it in with the actual scene; 
thereÅfs a compositing tool in the software 
which lets you take a number of layers and 
place them on top of one another.Åf 
Edge How did you make the helicopters 
shiny  like the H-Ks from Terminator 2? 
JB ÅeAgain itÅfs all done on computer, using 
material techniques, texture maps; lightingÅfs 
also very important. When we did the 
bluescreen video, we basically had two 
keylights either side and we found we were 
getting it very bright on the sides. To 
recreate that on the computer, | put very 
intense lights either side and found | was 
getting a matching of live action with the 
generated footage. 
ÅeIt also helps if you you mess around 
with the textures, if you flaw the texture, 
try not to get it looking perfect  one thing Step two: The helicopter is simply 
shaded and coloured to show its 
three-dimensional surface. There are no 
textures, effects or shadows at this 
stage, itÅfs just a basic representation of 
the modelÅfs form to see whether it looks 
right or not 
Step three: Images are mapped onto the 
surface for added detail and texture, 
similar to decals on a model aircraft. 
Much of the detail is made from simple 
2D images drawn on an Amiga and 
imported into the rendering program. 
Different symbols and textures can be 
wrapped around the 3D model ina 
variety of ways 
Step four: The lights in the scene are 
changed from Åeno-shadowÅf to 
Åeray-tracedÅf, which means that they now 
cast shadows correctly. At this point the 
artist can try different lighting set-ups to 
see which one provides the best images 
Step five: Different images can easily be 
layered on top of each other  or 
ÅecompositedÅf  using the rendering 
software. In the previous image not only 
did the computer render the RGB colour 
information, but it also generated a 
transparency mask. The helicopter is 
then easily ÅepastedÅf on top of another 
image  in this case a view of Bodor city

uniform. Players were shot against blue- 
screen and composited into the 3D scenery Edge The cityscape background looks 
massively complex; how do you do that? 
JB ÅeThe background is a very simple 
cyclorama. ItÅfs a rendered city: IÅfve taken a 
frame of the city and texture-mapped it 
onto the cyclorama.Åf 
Edge Just like a 3D image projected onto a 
2D plane? 
JB ÅeYeah, itÅfs quite a speedy thing to do. 
We cut as many corners as we can. If 
you've got a static background with no 
movement on it, you donÅft go rendering 
the background every time, which could be 
horrendously complicated. We also use a 
lot of compositing; itÅfs just the most simple, 
efficient method.Åf 
Edge But itÅfs quicker to render for the FM 
Towns because it only shows 256 colours? 
JB ÅeNo, everything's still rendered in 24-bit, 
millions of colours and then we 
downgrade them with compression 
techniques. TheyÅfre then given to the 
programmers who crunch Åfem onto disk.Åf 
Edge In the game proper, how did you do 
the vein walls? 
JB ÅeNeil Thompson, the second lead 
visualiser, did the legwork on that 
technique along with Gorvan Corbett. 
ItÅfs a series of loops: you set up a series 
of sections, and you make sure they 
continue one on from the other. 
You have limited visibility as well, so 
you donÅft have to put hundreds of 
animations in the background.Åf 
Edge So the dark and moody 
atmosphere hides a multitude of sins? 
JB ÅeIt certainly does!Åf 
Edge Over to you Neil 
Thompson; how did the veins 
come about? 
Neil Thompson ÅeThe veins were the 
first idea, and they were essential to 
the product. We tried a couple of 
simple left, right junctions and then it MicrocosmÅfs lead programmer, John Gibson, 
getting to grips with the FM Towns machine 
got more and more complicated, and now 
there are thousands of veins in there. 
ÅeThe idea was to get a visual feast and 
tie a game in there somewhere as well. We 
knew that gameplay on CD was going to be 
limited, and the real strength of CD is that 
you can get piles and piles of graphics in.Åf 
Edge So how are the veins created? 
NT ÅeItÅfs basically a cylinder: you can 
randomise the points on a tube to give it an 
uneven textured effect. The tricky bit was 
trying to get them to wrap, because you 
canÅft run 2,000 frames and then duplicate 
them, so we had to think of a way of doing 
them in short bursts. | think they ended up 
being in short 20-frame bursts, so you get a 
straight, and then a junction, and then you 
go back onto the same straight again, all

Edge What, for you, is the next step? 
NT ÅeI'd like to see lots of surreal stuff. In 
computer graphics everythingÅfs too clean 
cut, too obvious. Everyone does big 
spaceships, planets, all that sort of stuff. 
Not more imagination, but a bit more flair. 
Edge How much of the gameÅfs potential 
do you thing you've fulfilled? 
NT ÅeAbout 25%? It could have been a lot 
better, but we couldnÅft justify spending five 
years doing it. By then, people would have 
had all sorts of games out and we'd have 
missed the boat. This way weÅfre first in.Åf Åf 
But pretty pictures do nota 
game make: without some heavy code, all 
those lovely 3D images donÅft do very 
much. The man who injected life into the 
veins of Microcosm was John Gibson, the 
projectÅfs lead programmer. 
Edge WhatÅfs so special about FM Towns? 
John Gibson ÅeThe most significant things 
are its CD-ROM and its graphics. It has 
2Mb of RAM  thatÅfs the minimum 
configuration  and we use |.5Mb as a CD 
buffer, with the rest of it as a workspace 
and for the program itself. 
ÅeEverything on the Towns is a sprite: 
the film was all sprites, everything thatÅfs 
laid on top of it is a sprite  the only thing 
that isnÅft is the control panel! You can have 
up to 1,024 16x16 sprites on screen so you 
just bolt them all together like a sheet of 
postage stamps. ThatÅfs the best way of

a dramatic flypast en route to the CT tower techview: CD-ROM 
doing it, as thereÅfs a sprite controller in 
there which leaves the 386 processor to 
do lots of other juicy things.Åf 
Edge What difficulties did you encounter 
coming to CD games? 
JG ÅeObviously itÅfs the sheer volume of the 
data: the principle problem is getting the 
data off the CD quickly enough. Ultimately 
that means you have to compress it 
something rotten; we've got some pretty 
sophisticated compression techniques but 
because youÅfve got to decompress the stuff 
so quickly, that limits how much you can 
compress it in the first place. 
ÅeWhen the film comes from the Silicon 
Graphics, itÅfs three bytes per pixel, so 
youÅfre talking 108K per frame. When we 
get it itÅfs in a nibble per pixel format which 
comes out at 18K, and we can get them 
right down to 9K. It doesnÅft lose a lot in 
quality: the only thing you really notice is a 
bit of banding. Because you havenÅft got so 
many colours, you donÅft get the same sort 
of anti-aliasing. 
ÅeThe CD theoretically can only supply 
us with around 7Åã5 to 8K for each frame, 
so weÅfre always running a bit over the top. 
But there are ways of getting round that; a 
lot is to do with designing efficiently. 
ÅeIt runs at 15 frames a second  itÅfs 
fast enough, but it would have been nice if 
it had been 20. To do that, weÅfd have had 
to make the images a lot simpler and it 
wouldnÅft have been so impressive. We 
opted in the end for more complex images 
at 15 frames a second rather than black 
screens at 20 frames a second!Åf 
Edge What else can the CD format do? 
JG ÅeYou can use it for giant data tables as 
well. You can speed up all the processing 
that way: instead of the processor doing 
the maths, you do it on a utility and store 
the data in a table. It might be a 64 or 128K 
table which you canÅft load in off floppy disk, 
because it stops the game. But because the 
CD always loads stuff in about five to ten 
seconds before itÅfs needed, you can load 
these tables in and when youÅfve finished 
with them, throw them away, because you 
can load them in next time you want them.Åf

FM Towns Marty 
The FM Marty console - baby brother of 
FujitsuÅfs stunning FM Towns 
ujitsu stole a march on their 
competitors five years ago when 
they released the first CD-based 
computer in Japan. The oddly-named FM 
Towns was (and still is) ahead of its 
time, running a fast 32-bit 386 CPU 
with a full 16 million colour palette. 
A home console version was launched 
earlier this year. The equally 
oddly-named Marty boasts a CD drive, 
internal 3-5Åh HD floppy disk drive and a 
smartcard slot, all for about Åí500. 
Marketed as a games machine, it comes 
with a dinky three-button joypad, 
although you can also get a mouse and 
keyboard for FM Towns compatibility. 
The Marty has the same spec as a 
low-end Towns, running at 16MHz. It 
has a screen resolution of 307,200 pixels 
(640x480) and can display up to 32,768 
colours on screen. The majority of 
graphics are generated using a dedicated 
sprite engine  with the potential for 
1,024 16x16 hardware sprites. 
It supports six-channel FM and 
eight-channel PCM stereo sound, and the 
Marty has AV and S-VHS ports, plus 
mike and earphone sockets. 
But thanks to FujitsuÅfs parochial 
distribution and marketing policies itÅfs 
unlikely the FM Towns will ever be sold 
in large quantities in Europe, although 
the Marty is now being featured in 
several big US games mags.

Paul Franklin reports that the plane has arrived ago when he met some of 
the Psygnosis management 
at a concert. ÅeI knew 
Psygnosis because of 
Lemmings, which my kids 
play,Åe he said. ÅeThey asked 
me if IÅfd ever thought 
about doing music for 
computer games, and I 
said yes, but itÅfs 
unbelievably inhibitive.Åf 
With the advent of the 
CD format, Psygnosis 
were able to offer Rick the 
freedom to write his music 
under normal recording 
conditions  which is 
exactly what he did. 
ÅeI was in the studio for 
eight or nine days, and 
then went back for another 
two days. It was a great 
thing to do and IÅfd love to 
do some more... I was

Total code able to use the full studio 
facilities and put out some 
music that IÅfd be delighted 
to appear on a normal CD. 
I really felt part of a 
pioneering project.Åf 
Choosing instruments 
he thought would be most 
suited to the project, Rick 
used a Korg 01/W Pro-X, 
a Kurzweil 2000, a Korg 
Wavestation, a Roland 
JD-900, an Ensoniq SQX, 
and several others from his 
extensive collection of 
synths and keyboards. 
It was all recorded onto 
the Steinberg Cubase 
system and parts of it were 
transferred to a 24-track 
Otari for tweaking. It was 
mixed onto DAT (Digital 
Audio Tape) at a high 
sample rate of 48kHz as 
against the normal 
commercial rate of 44.1.

ÅgThe wireframe form was rendered on the 
Indigo, and touched up on an Amiga bit, millions of colours  so how do you 
use them on the Towns? 
JG ÅeWe've got utilities that begin by 
degrading the image, then in the case of the 
Towns we have a palette of 256 colours, 
but itÅfs not 256 colours all over the screen. 
The screenÅfs like a series of 16x16 cells 
and each cell can have a selection of 
colours from that 256 colour palette. Once 
thatÅfs been done, the dataÅfs compressed 
and presented to the programmer.Åf 
Edge Is the lack of colour a limitation? 
JG ÅeOne of the big advantages of the 
Towns is that you can run it in a 32,000 
colour mode. As long as youÅfre careful 
about the images, 256 colours is more than 
enough. In fact the utility often generates 
less than 256 colours  about 220  so itÅfs 
not really at the edge of our limitation.Åf 
Edge How do you get all that data from 
the artists? 
JG ÅeWe've got a network so all the Silicon 
Graphic Indigos, all the PCs, all the Macs 
are all joined together and we've got a file 
server, like a central pool for everything. 
Say JimÅfs produced a 50-frame film on the 
Indigo: the utility will pick those 50 frames 
up, choose the best palette for that film, 
degrade the image by that palette, pack the 
data and spew out something thing that the 
Towns can take. My PCÅfs on the network, 
so | can take and read that file from the 
network and can send it straight to the 
Towns  thereÅfs a scuzzy [SCSI] link 
between the PC and the Towns. Then we 
put the data on a hard disk which acts like 
a pseudo CD to try it out and check it.Åf 
Edge How long do the non-interactive 
movie sequences last? 
JG ÅeWe generated around 44,000 frames of 
animation.Åf 
Edge How do you archive that stuff, and 
how do you play it all back? 
JG ÅeYou've got to be careful how you lay 
the CD out to cut down the seek times. 
ThatÅfs one of the biggest problems: you 
donÅft want to go from one end of the CD 
to the other, because it takes so long. So 
there are certain files that are common to 
various levels in Microcosm.

all the time, which contains most of the 
stuff like reading the CD, handling the 
sound, changing screen modes, god knows 
what else, and then every level is an 
overlay thatÅfs loaded in with its own unique 
piece of code.Åf 
Edge It seems that you have masses of 
cinematic background for the intravenous 
sections  how do you handle it all? 
JG ÅeA lot of it is broken up into small films, 
no more than about 50 frames, and theyÅfre 
all chained together to produce the final 
thing. ThatÅfs why you can come along one 
part of the brain and branch one way, 
branch another way. In just one level 
thereÅfs probably something like 1,500 
frames  say 30 films at 50 frames each. 
And youÅfve got that six times over, for 
each level.Åf 
Edge How much more interactive can you 
make CD games? 
JG: ÅeAll the CD does is just keep reading 
files until something tells it not to. ItÅfs a 
standard |50K/second drive. 3DO is 
300K/second, and probably this new Amiga 
CD console will have a 300K, too. [Edge: 
it does.] Anyone producing aÅeCD drive now 
would be mad not to have a 300K drive. 
ÅeThe real restriction with interactivity 
is the rate at which you can get the stuff off 
the CD: 150K/sec is a severe restriction; 
300K/sec is going to make a hell of a lot of 
difference. At the moment we can just 
about handle a three-way branch, if you try 
to go up to four itÅfs getting a bit iffy. We 
could have four branches but weÅfd 
probably have to drop the frame rate after techview: CD-ROM

Richard Browne, designer and producer of 
Microcosm, through the round window 
in fact a really good game can probably fit 
in a single meg. If we did it as a two floppy 
game on the Amiga, it would have five 
levels, but itÅfs a CD product so it has 200 
levels. A good game doesnÅft have to have 
lots of graphics and lots of sound, but a 
good game can be enhanced by them.Åf 
Edge In that case, how big is Microcosm? 
JG ÅeMicrocosm totally filled a CD up. 
Obviously thereÅfs quite a bit of audio on 
there as well, which is just played like an 
ordinary CD. The sound effects are totally 
separate, theyÅfre data just like any other 
data thatÅfs loaded off the CD.Åf 
Edge How much of Rick WakemanÅfs 
music is there? 
JG ÅeThere must be something like 200- 
250Mb of music. There are eight tracks, 
and theyÅfre all about a minute each, and the 
introÅfs about three minutes, so thereÅfs 
about |2 minutes of audio in there.Åf 
Edge Just how does the CD music know 
when to play? 
JG ÅeItÅfs all synched: for example to play an 
audio track, you tell the CD to seek to 
where the audio track is and sit and wait, 
so when you get to the point in the game 
where you want it to play, it can start 
straight away. And then you either let it ÅeWith so many 
ideas, the big 
f problem was 
bringing it all 
to an endÅf 
Richard Browne, designer/producer 
play until itÅfs finished, or you can tell the 
CD: forget the audio track, go back into 
data mode and start loading files again.Åf 
Edge End-of-level bosses are all rendered 
films, so what happens if you kill the boss 
before the film has finished running? 
JG ÅeThe obvious way to do it is just play a 
film and when you get to the end you say, 
have you hit it enough times? Yes you have, 
he dies; no you havenÅft, so you die. But it 
doesnÅft have to 
work like that: 
thereÅfs a facility 
within the core 
program to get to 
anywhere in the (sit ere) TERE 
film, stop and 
restart somewhere 
else. It does take a 
bit of time because 
you've got to tell the CD to stop what itÅfs doing and go off 
and seek somewhere else. ThereÅfs a certain 
delay there, so we bring up some simple 
flashing screen to cover the fact that weÅfre 
killing time while the CDÅfs trying to find 
the next film  something like the playerÅfs 
face that can be stored in memory all the 
time and then just shoved into the video 
RAM when itÅfs needed.Åf 
Edge For you, whatÅfs the best thing about 
Microcosm? 
JG ÅeI was pleased that it all came together. 
Having five programmers, half-a-dozen 
artists and a couple of musicians all 
working together is a relatively new thing  
certainly in this country anyway. And the 
fact that it all came together, | think that is 
the greatest achievement. Some of the guys 
that programmed it hadnÅft been near a 
Towns before, and some of them hadnÅft 
even programmed the 386 chip before 
Microcosm. And yet they did a damn good 
Every detail of Microcosm was documented in detail before work began. Designer Richard 
BrowneÅfs storyboard (top left) runs to 46 pages and, as you can see, the game sticks pretty 
closely to it. On entering the first waystation, you proceed along the neon-lit corridors (top right);

job of it because they 
didnÅft have to do all 
the low-level stuff, 
that was all done for

personal point of 
view, the greatest 
achievement in the 
game is the fact that it 
all actually works!

Despite their stunning 
graphics, both PsygnosisÅf Microcosm and the 
Mega CD version of Dracula have been 
criticised for simplistic gameplay. Edge 
suggested to lan Heatherington, joint 
Managing Director of Psygnosis, that the 
first CD titles were Åeall show and no goÅf. 
lan Heatherington ÅeWhen we produce a 
new product, something like Microcosm, 
technologically itÅfs very state-of-the-art. 
But itÅfs being manufactured effectively to 
go on something like the Mega CD. The 
Mega CD player is a Sonic player, a Mickey 
and Donald player. With an inexperienced 
gamesplayer, you cannot afford to present 
radical gameplay options. 
ÅeItÅfs no good going along with a 
Monkey Island 2 or a super-sophisticated 
role playing game  this is not an 
interactive movie: this is a videogame. ItÅfs 
engineered as a videogame, it plays like a 
videogame  thatÅfs all it was ever intended 
to be. What we're trying to do is bring 
cinematic technology techniques to the 
videogame experience. If that was our 
objective, then we've been successful. 
ÅeMicrocosm and Dracula are targeted at 
the existing marketplace on.CD. In some 
ways IÅfm pre-empting criticism of the 
product: because people look at it and 
because it looks so wonderful, they 
probably expect more from it. ItÅfs not 
actually meant to deliver more. 
ÅeWeÅfre also doing things like The Last 
Action Hero. We're now a member of the 
Sony group  thatÅfs for a lot of reasons; 
we need access to intellectual properties in 
a privileged way. But within the concept of:

24 Too late: AxiomÅfs miniaturised devices 
have been injected into Korsby. Axiom 
now control the head of the head of Cybertech ÅeHereÅfs an intellectual property, buy the 
licence, develop the game in six months, 
and do the best you canÅf, you cannot be 
technically innovative; it has to be formula- 
driven because the most important thing is 
time; nothing else matters. So the process 
defines the output, unfortunately. 
ÅeWhat we've got is something like 40 
man-yearsÅf of experience in producing 
these games. We have the technology, 
we're on all the CD-ROM formats: we 
even know about a few that you donÅft 
know about yet.Åf [Edge: donÅft count on it.] 
Edge Are you happy with Microcosm? 
1H ÅeI think Microcosm has defined state-of- 
' the-art. If you ask any creative person, are 
you happy with what youÅfve produced, well 
no theyÅfre not; they never are. And thatÅfs 
what drives them. 
ÅeBut with what we've learned from 
our experiences to date, we can 
go on and make some really _ 
staggeringly good products.Åf

Testscreen is the part of the magazine

biggest games from each month. 
There are two sections to Testscreen: 
the reviews themselves appear on pages 
82-88  this is where Edge passes 
comment and awards a rating out of 
ten. And, unlike other magazines, when 
we say five, we mean five: this game is 
strictly average. Anything above is good 
and getting better; anything below is 
bad and heading for crap. Simple. 
Then, the higher rated  or simply 
more interesting  games earn a place 
in our showcase (pages 90-107). Here, 
Edge can go into more detail about the 
gameplay, the levels, the bosses  and it 
provides space for bigger screenshots. 
This issue is something of an oddity: 
the best titles are either sequels or 
remakes of very old games. Not exactly 
state of the art, but for unadulterated 
gameplaying excellence, they fa

Format: SNES 
Publisher: Capcom 
Price: Åí90 (Jap import) 
e prayers of Street 
_ Fighter II devotees have 
: _ at last been answered. 
This latest version of Street 
Fighter II contains both 
Championship gameplay, and a 
Turbo edition with four speed 
settings (plus six hidden ones), 
ranging from Åepretty quickÅf to 
Åeludicrously rapidÅf. 
The Turbo game also 
contains the long-awaited new 
moves, such as Chun-LiÅfs 
fireball or Ken and RyuÅfs mid-air 
hurricane kick, and has tweaked 
some of the old moves so that 
they're longer and harder. 
In both versions, there are 
new frames of animation, the 
backdrops have had a fresh 
coat of paint, and thereÅfs extra 
sampled speech. But not all the 
changes are for the better: the 
option and character screens 
arenÅft as slick, and the game 
doesnÅft look quite as polished. 
However this is small 
CORRE T UES SCES EEL ECO RO LEEES Vega relies on cunning and guile 
to defeat Sagat... sort of 
potatoes compared to the 
improvements to the gameplay. 
There can be few SFi/ players 
who won't welcome four new 
characters, new moves and a 
massive injection of speed. 
You can see why Sega were 
less than happy to see a Turbo 
edition appear on the SNES 
before the Mega Drive has even 
had a taste of the six-button 
beat Åfem up. God knows what 
Capcom are doing to appease 
the Sega management: itÅfs 
quite possible MD SFI will 
include all the versions so far At last: real, proper two-player boss-on-boss action without resorting to 
Game Genie or Action Replay codes that turn their faces blue 
and have new characters and 
backdrops. Until then, this is 
the ultimate beat Åeem up: no 
other has the same characters 
or moves  or the sheer 
finger-aching, mind-numbing 
gameplay. 
If you own SNES SFI/ itÅfs still 
a tricky decision whether you 
ceeesseese should buy Turbo: at current 
import prices, probably not. 
But if youÅfve yet to be 
introduced to the genteel art of 
street-fighting, and have a few 
pounds to shed, SFi/ = 
Turbo is the one to get.

_ uietly, without all the 
hype surrounding the 
SNES and Mega Drive 
versions, the PC Engine 
Championship Edition has 
entered the street-fighting 
arena. The hardware may well 
be six years old, but it can still 
hack it when it comes to fast 
gameplay. With a few 
concessions, primarily in the 
sound department, PC Engine 
SFil is pretty much identical to 
the SNES version. None of the 
gameplay has been 
compromised whatsoever  
thereÅfs all the same characters 
and moves (hell, thereÅfs even 
an extra rock on the floor in 
Chun-LiÅfs stage). 
Because itÅfs the 
Championship Edition, you get 
to play all four bosses, and all 
of the bonus stages are 
included  no missing out the 
barrel section like with SNES 
SFil. And on the gameplay front 
PC Engine Street Fighter 2 supplied by Console Concepts: 0782 712759 thereÅfs little else to say. It plays 
as well as youÅfd expect; there 
are few unpleasant surprises 
and it very much comes down to 
personal preference, whether 
you like your hard kick and 
punch buttons on the front of 
the pad (SNES-style) or taking 
up a pair of buttons on a 
six-button pad. These flaming Chinamen don't 
half get under your feet...

sadly it sticks to the same old 
level-boss, level-boss structure 
(like nine out of ten Mega 
Drive games) so no marks for 
innovation there. 
In typical Konami style, 
there are several difficulty 
levels, and on Easy you can 
slice through half the game in 
one go. But, if you can restrain 
your cheating tendencies,

ince Konami branched 
out onto Mega Drive, 
Super NES owners 
have continued to enjoy the 
benefits of KonamiÅfs close 
links with the big ÅeNÅf: 
consistently getting the best 
games first, with conversions 
to the Mega Drive usually 
following afterwards. 
Sunset Riders is the first 
to change that, with the 
SNES version appearing a 
good six months to a year 
after the rather disappointing 
Mega Drive version. But, 
woooahhh! This is a far 
superior conversion with 
better graphics and all the 
stages that were left out of 
the Sega version. ItÅfs a spot- 
on conversion of the arcade, 
in fact. So, hereÅfs what 
it has to offer... 
Sunset Riders has 
the same kind of 
spilt-level gameplay

like Rolling Thunder At last, justice! The Sunset Riders reap 
revenge on those evil TravellersÅf Fare 
buffet car stewards Sunset Riders

Each level has a different bad guy to take 
out, rather like that old coin-op Gunsmoke 
The two-player 
simultaneous option is 
pretty good fun, and 
thereÅfs no slow-down 
either. But come on, 
those pink bullets are 
just silly (above) 
Running on cattle is 
not recommended 
Level two starts off with a tricky section where youÅfre riding behind a 
wagon dropping logs with a bloke firing out of the back at you. And as if 
that isnÅft enough, these horse riders try and take you out, too. Horrible Now, whatÅfs the point walking 
around the fire when you can 
hang from a rope one-handed, 
shooting all the bad guys at 
the same time?

WhatÅfs your opinion? Write and tell us: 
he kind of CD games 
that we have seen so far 
have, frankly, been far 
from mind-blowing. 
At the moment, all | see are 
pretty pictures displayed on 
screen, clever introduction 
sequences, etc. If thatÅfs what you 
want, why not watch television? 
Until the standard of 
gameplay is improved to the 
same extent that the graphics 
have been, CD will not make the 
sort of impact it is capable of. 
In order to do so, the format 
needs a game with the same sort 
of playability as games like Mario 
and Sonic did on cartridges. At 
the moment everything on CD 
can be done on carts if you could 
afford to make them big enough. 
Has anyone out there been 
genuinely impressed with 
anything theyÅfve seen on CD? 
What genre of games do you 
think best suit CD? And isnÅft 
Tetris on the Game Boy better 
than any of them? 
Fergus McGovern 
Probe Software 
Fergus has a point. Edge is as 
much in favour of new 
technology as anyone. And while 
titles like Silpheed and 7th Guest 
go some way to restoring the 
mediumÅfs flagging reputation, 
until some decent games are 
produced, with real leaps in the 
quality of gameplay, CD will 
remain the realm of extended 
intros and hi-definition sound. 
What do you think? Edge 
wants to hear from anyone  
readers, programmers, designers 
 with an opinion on the 
progress and prospects of 
CD-ROM. And if CD isnÅft the 
medium of the future, _ 
what the hell is? or Mega Drive coverage | 
am well satisfied with 
Mega, therefore | will 
probably not buy Edge for | 6-bit 
console coverage. Can you tell 
me, or give me an idea, how much 
coverage is planned for the 
newest 32-bit home videogame 
consoles such as CBMÅfs Amiga 
CD32 and the 3DO machine? | 
know 3DO isnÅft even released 
Stateside yet, but itÅfs the kind of 
sexy piece of kit that (wet) 
dreams are made of. Technoporn? 
Yes please! 
Daren Chandisingh

Hopefully our feature on 3DO 
(page 48 if you sailed blindly past 
it) should keep you... excited until 
our real 3DO coverage = 
starts later on in the year. 
hilst browsing through the 
latest Amiga Format, | saw 
an article about Edge. At 
first | thought it was this new 
Mega Drive thing which allows a 
keyboard to be plugged in (itÅfs a 
modem  see page |5). 
After reading it | thought that 
| would air my views about game 
prices. When | first got my Amiga 
a year ago | thought that the price Thunderhawk on Mega CD. Does it 
raise any questions in your head? 
of games was just right but 
recently | bought Lemmings 2 
which was priced at just under 
Åí30. This and Walker. 
You and | both know that 
these games are worth the extra 
pounds, but how long is it before 
other companies see that they can 
get away with it and Åí29.99 
becomes the standard price mark? 
Simon Wilmot 
Wiltshire 
Videogame pricing is always a 
bone of contention. And itÅfs ironic 
that as games move onto the 
cheaper medium of CD, costs 
must increase to cover the higher 
development costs. Perhaps 
direct-broadcast games will ae 
solve everyoneÅfs problems?
